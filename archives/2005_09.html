      <h1>Transform</h1>

      <h2>8 September 2005</h2>

      <p>
        Monday night, as I returned to familiar territory after my fourth
        journey to Black Rock City, I was struck again by how much one week can
        change everything. Burning Man has always been a transformative
        experience for me -- each year, I've come back a different person. But
        this time, as I learned more about the extent of the disaster in the
        South (and about how it impacted the families of some friends of mine),
        I realized that the world had also changed quite a bit, in my absence.
        When I caught my first glimpse of San Francisco across the bay from the
        final leg of the drive home on I-80, it hit me: I will be living a new
        life in this new place, whether I want to or not.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's one of the reasons I seek out transformative experiences like
        Burning Man. Transforming myself -- learning new ways to relate to the
        world -- is a way of equipping myself to accept and manage change. It's
        an attempt to grow more perspective, which, I hope, will help me make my
        life (and, in my more naive moments, maybe even some little piece of the
        world) a better place to be.
      </p>

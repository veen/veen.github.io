        Ours is a perilous time, apparently: since the group's inception,
        members have posted nearly 4,000 photos of "warning signs showing stick
        figures in dangerous, often life-threatening, situations" (as the
        group's original description puts it). Here's the awesome photo that
        started it all:

          >The Shins</a
        >
        -- for one, Ben Bridwell's voice sounds an awful lot like James Mercer's
        -- and, frankly, the similarities between the two bands was reason
        enough for me to take an almost automatic (though still tentative)
        liking to them early on. But as I've settled in to this record, that
        comparison has receeded into the background, and I've realized how great
        some of these songs really are.
      </p>

      <p>
        "The Funeral" is one of the best of the songs. It's got this great line,
        belted out over and over: "At every occasion, I'll be ready for a
        funeral." Amazingly, this doesn't come across as corny; in fact, it's
        incredible and powerful and -- I want to be careful to not be corny here
        myself, but -- almost majestic. <em>Majesty</em>: it's the word the

          >Pitchfork review</a
        >
        uses, which puts it better than I can: "Turning despondency into indie
        majesty is a major talent of Band of Horses; their music is carefully
        balanced to evoke specific emotional responses while allowing space for
        personal projection."
      </p>

      <p>
        Ok, so I think all this talk <em>has</em> gotten a little corny. Just go
        listen to this great record. And listen closely.

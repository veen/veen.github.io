      <h1>All hail the iPhone?</h1>

      <h2>26 July 2004</h2>

      <p>Will Apple make cell phones?  Mike Davidson <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archives/000026.php">goes on record</a> saying it'll happen in 2005.  Fascinating.</p>

      <h1>Welcome to Portland, sponsored by...</h1>

      <h2>20 July 2004</h2>

      <p>Shortly after boarding one of Portland, Oregon's streetcars during a visit there last weekend, I heard what seemed at first to be a run-of-the-mill automated system announcement, made by one of those computerized voices that are becoming eerily hard to distinguish from human ones: "Next stop, Taylor Street." </p>

      <p>But after a short pause, the voice added: "Sponsored by Whole Foods of Portland."</p>

      <p>What?  The <em>streetcar stops</em> are sponsored -- in <em>Portland</em>?</p>

      <p>And it's not just the streetcar stops, I learned a minute later when the voice resumed, this time with out even a pretense of giving me important information about an upcoming stop:  "This streetcar sponsored by Hoyt Street Realty."</p>

      <p>I guess it's not hugely different than the print ads on the sides of busses common in many cities, but this certainly <a href="http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/ads/ad_main.htm">turns it up a notch</a>.</p>

      <h1>Why vote for Ralph Nader?</h1>

      <h2>15 July 2004</h2>

      <p>In today's <em>Examiner</em>, Matt Gonzalez <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/index.cfm/i/071404op_gonzalez">explains</a> why he thinks voting for Ralph Nader is the right thing to do.</p>

      <h1>One must put up barriers to keep oneself intact</h1>

      <h2>12 July 2004</h2>

      <p>As nerdy as it is, I hereby proudly announce that I enjoyed the heck out of the Rush show I went to in Concord on Saturday night.</p>

      <p>I used to be more of an actual fan than I am now.  Yet even though a lot of the evening's fun was, how do you say, <em>sociological</em> in nature (look, that middle-aged dude in the lawn seats is totally air drumming!), I have to admit that Rush <em>rocked</em>.</p>

      <p>Merlin Mann seemed to <a href="http://merlinmann.buzznet.com/user/?img=2&id=365303">enjoy</a> it too.</p>

      <h1>Return of the trucker-hatted indie zombies</h1>

        show in San Francisco last Friday, I've been told they rocked. But the
        crowd apparently didn't. I've heard reports of what I'm recognizing as
        an increasingly common phenomenon at shows with indie appeal. Masses of
        (sometimes trucker-hatted) hipsters <em>observe</em> shows like this in
        a state of detached indie cool: trying desperately to supress any
        visible signs of emotional investment, they conservatively nod their
        heads to the beat, occasionally sipping from their over-priced pints of
        Pabst. It's amazing. I have no idea how they can resist the need to,
        well, at least <em>move</em> when exposed to such rockingly great music.
      </p>

      <p>
        I often wonder what the musicians think of this. Sometimes I think it
        must be disappointing for them. But you never know. Case in point: I was
        at a

        show at the Bottom of the Hill two or three years ago, trapped in the
        middle of an agonizingly catatonic crowd. After the show, I approached
        the band members (as that venue allows so well) and apologized to the
        singer for the crowd's lack of enthusiasm. He looked puzzled, and said,
        "What do you mean? San Francisco has our best audiences outside of
        Seattle, besides maybe Portland." Nothing seemed wrong to him.

      <p>So should I ligthen up on the trucker-hatted indie zombies?</p>

      <h1>Why XHTML?</h1>

      <h2>15 October 2004</h2>

      <p>
        A recent discussion with one of my favorite friends and co-workers about
        building websites has made me decide to publish my repsonse here to a
        very specific question he asked me: why use
        <abbr title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> when
        developing websites?
      </p>

      <p>
        The case for XHTML has certainly been made many times before, by people
        more expert than I. Yet time and time again I'm asked,
        <em>why</em> use XHTML at all? The question is often posed by engineers
        rightly concerned about the extra bandwidth costs incurred by always
        quoting attributes and closing tags, as XHTML demands. Why not shave off
        extra characters from our code by using the looser syntax of earlier
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> versions?
      </p>

      <p>
        The reason to use XHTML in fact <em>is</em> that its syntax requirements
        are much more explicit than those of earlier HTML versions, and that
        these requirements can be tested (and violations of them pinpointed) by
        a
        <a
          href="http://validator.w3.org/"
          title="The W3C Markup Validation Service"
          >validator</a
        >. Elements must be properly closed; element attribute values must be
        quoted; and so on. Why does this matter, particularly when it adds extra
        characters to a site's markup? Why should we do this, when if you scale
        up that extra data on a high traffic site, you're looking at a
        significant extra cost?
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's why. Easily finding structural errors in our markup (not to
        mention keeping the markup small, simple, and structurally meaningful)
        makes it enormously more possible to rely on
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> for presentation. And
        that let's us strip out all those old-school tables and spacer gifs and
        font tags and &lt;br&gt; tags from our markup. The character savings we
        earn by doing that will far outweigh the character costs that result
        from quoting our element attributes and properly closing all our
        elements. True, our CSS will get a little bigger, but the benefit of
        putting our presentational code there is that we put it there once and
        re-use it across all our pages. The bandwidth cost savings can be
        dramatic: a
        <a
          href="http://www.stopdesign.com/articles/throwing_tables/"
          title="Stop Design | Throwing Tables Out the Window"
          >recent analysis</a
        >
        of Microsoft's homepage showed they could save 329 terabytes per year on
        homepage views <em>alone</em> by doing this.
      </p>

      <p>
        But, you might ask, couldn't we do the same thing with HTML 4.01? Why
        <em>exactly</em> does XHTML's strict syntax make it more feasible to
        move our presentational code from our markup to our stylesheet? The
        answer is that once we start relying on CSS for more of our
        presentation, we'll need to take advantage of certain features and
        characteristics of CSS that <em>require</em> we have markup that's
        structurally sound. For example, we can use CSS to specify that our H2
        elements should be rendered one way when they're contained within an
        element we've tagged with a class of "sidebar" and another way all other
        times. Considering the increasingly sophisticated effects we can achieve
        with CSS, this will allow us to produce some visually compelling site
        elements with minimal markup. And they'll be re-usable: after the first
        page load, all we have to do to render them again is send that tiny bit
        of markup -- the CSS is already cached.
      </p>

      <p>
        But for this to work, our CSS has to be able to know an element's place
        in the structure of the document that contains it. If, for example, we
        fail to close that "sidebar" element I just mentioned, what happens to
        any H2 elements after it? Should they be rendered according to the
        "sidebar" rules or not? Well, are they contained within a "sidebar"
        element? Now that we've corrupted our document structure, it's hard to
        say. Is everything after we open that "sidebar" contained within it,
        since we never closed it? Or is nothing contained within it, since,
        lacking closure, it's not really a container at all anymore. Our site's
        presentation starts to crumble.
      </p>

      <p>
        We could try to hack around the mess by relying less on these sorts of
        <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#descendant-selectors"
          title="CSS 2.1 Specification: Descendant Selectors"
          >descendent selectors</a
        >, but then we'd need to add more "hooks" to our markup in order to
        apply the right style rules. We could give each H2 a class or id in the
        markup and reference those in our CSS to specify how they should be
        rendered. But then our markup and stylesheet get bloated and complicated
        again. We've lost one of the important benefits that sent us down this
        path in the first place.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, we <em>need</em> valid, well-formed pages in order to gain all the
        advantages of separating presentational code from our markup (and I've
        mentioned only some of the advantages). Yes, we could develop pages this
        way in earlier versions of HTML, but it is just so much easier and more
        efficient to code to a standard with explicit syntax requirements that
        can be validated. That way, we can know that our pages are structurally
        sound and valid while we're building them, and we can quickly identify
        mistakes and fix them before they're propagated across a sprawling site.
      </p>

      <p>
        In short, it's a way to enforce the standards we need to rely on when
        developing sites with CSS -- and thereby gain all those advantages of
        "standards-based development" everyone keeps shouting about.

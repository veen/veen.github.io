        show in San Francisco last Friday, I've been told they rocked. But the
        crowd apparently didn't. I've heard reports of what I'm recognizing as
        an increasingly common phenomenon at shows with indie appeal. Masses of
        (sometimes trucker-hatted) hipsters <em>observe</em> shows like this in
        a state of detached indie cool: trying desperately to supress any
        visible signs of emotional investment, they conservatively nod their
        heads to the beat, occasionally sipping from their over-priced pints of
        Pabst. It's amazing. I have no idea how they can resist the need to,
        well, at least <em>move</em> when exposed to such rockingly great music.

        I often wonder what the musicians think of this. Sometimes I think it
        must be disappointing for them. But you never know. Case in point: I was
        at a

        show at the Bottom of the Hill two or three years ago, trapped in the
        middle of an agonizingly catatonic crowd. After the show, I approached
        the band members (as that venue allows so well) and apologized to the
        singer for the crowd's lack of enthusiasm. He looked puzzled, and said,
        "What do you mean? San Francisco has our best audiences outside of
        Seattle, besides maybe Portland." Nothing seemed wrong to him.

      <p>So should I ligthen up on the trucker-hatted indie zombies?</p>

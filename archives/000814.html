        here before, but lately it's occured to me that I occasionally atomize
        my enjoyment of music down even further -- to the level of the "moment."
        You know what I'm talking about: that point in a particularly good tune
        when you're compelled to raise a clenched fist into the air and say
        <em>damn, this song rocks!</em> It's why I listen to music, frankly. I
        can't get enough of those moments, those times when you hear something
        that's just, well, <em>right</em> about a song. It's fantastic.
      </p>

      <p>
        And, of course, I'm here to tell you about one such moment. You know the
        band

          title="Wolf Parade MP3 Downloads - Wolf Parade Music Downloads - Wolf Parade Music Videos"
          >Wolf Parade</a
        >? Yeah, it's in their album
        <a
          href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/w/wolf-parade/apologies-to-the-queen-mary.shtml"
          title="Wolf Parade: Apologies to the Queen Mary: Pitchfork Review"
          ><em>Apologies to the Queen Mary</em></a
        >. First of all -- <em>wow</em>, what an album. It's good. It's really
        good. As a friend of mine put it, "it's fun in a post-Modest-Mouse kind
        of way." And he's right. But, hey, do me a favor a sec and queue up
        "Grounds for Divorce". Ah, listen to that opening syncopated
        straight-angle guitar riff. Then hear it overlaid with those frenetic
        David-Byrne-esque vocals. Then comes the rising tension with some
        wonderfully silly synths and rolling drums. And then? Yep, there's the
        moment. The song's unifying low end comes barrelling in at 0:53, and
        everything just <em>clicks</em>, right then and there. So great.

            That Wolf Parade, I'm tellin' ya. Grounds for Divorce is a great
            song. I love those theremins...

            But when I hear This Heart's On Fire, there's a moment when the
            refrain is turned up a notch and goes from singing "This heart's on
            fire" to screaming it. That's what does it for me...

            love your blog. did you ever get anywhere with the sparkplug
            problem?

            life is very different in africa. there's a big national vote coming
            up on monday (here in kenya) and lives could be lost due to rioting.

            it is hilarious to read about fat free water -- a nice break from
            what's going down here.

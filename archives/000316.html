      <h2>2 September 2003</h2>

      <p>
        I'm back from my second Burning Man, which was spectacular -- and
        essentially indescribable. I like how Electronic Frontier Foundation
        co-founder John Perry Barlow puts it: "The important thing about Burning
        Man is that it is the most experiential phenomenon I can think of. It
        can't be turned into data in any useful way. You can't informatize it by
        blogging it, filming it or taking pictures of it, because so much of it
        can't be translated into information."
      </p>

      <p>
        I also like how a friend of mine described his experience: "I cracked
        myself pretty wide open this year, and don't imagine I'll ever be quite
        the same again. I ran my soul thru the wringer and have come out leaner
        and cleaner for it. Back in the office I'm wavering between a normal
        work day and periodically wanting to burst or implode. The lesson
        learned: burn bright, kids; burn as bright as you possibly can every day
        you're alive."

            hey greg, sorry i didn't find you whilst i was there. i had a blast,
            and seems you did, too. "normal" america frightens me, but the playa
            is always a happy home.
          </p>

          <p>love the EFF quote--my blog recap of BM is so lame ;)</p>

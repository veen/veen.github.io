      <h1>Cory Doctorow on Digital Rights Management</h1>

      <h2>22 June 2004</h2>

      <p>
        By now, the text of the
        <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/stuff/doctorow-drm-ms.html"
          >speech</a
        >
        on Digital Rights Management technologies that Cory Doctorow recently
        gave to Microsoft's Research Group has been linked to so widely it's
        made its way nearly to the top of Google's search results for "DRM". I'm
        mentioning it here in case you haven't heard about it somewhere else. I
        highly recommend it. The speech offers a very well-put statement on an
        issue that's hugely important to all of us -- the ownership and control
        of culture.
      </p>

      <p>
        (I've linked above to Anil Dash's HTML version of the speech text
        instead of Doctorow's
        <a href="http://www.craphound.com/msftdrm.txt">original text version</a
        >.)

      <h1>Jack Valenti and me: copyfighters</h1>

      <h2>8 June 2004</h2>

      <p>
        My explorations into various understandings of intellecutal property and
        copyright have convinced me that our current system of copyright law is
        headed in a very dark direction and needs to change course soon.
        According to
        <a href="http://culturecat.net/node/view/415">Clancy Ratliff</a> (via
        <a href="http://www.corante.com/copyfight/archives/004250.html"
          >Copyfight: the politics of IP</a
        >) that makes me a <em>copyfighter</em>: "a copyfighter is someone who
        engages in conversations on authorship and intellectual property. [...]
        Moreover, copyfighters look at our current copyright model -- automatic
        copyright, life + 70 years as soon as the content is put into a fixed
        medium -- and express some kind of qualm about it; they think it should
        change in some way."
      </p>

      <p>
        But that definition doesn't specify <em>which</em> way the copyfighter
        thinks our copyright model should change. By this standard, even the
        infamous Jack Valenti -- the outgoing head of the MPAA who once
        <a href="http://news.com.com/2008-1082-875394.html"
          >referred to file swappers as terrorists</a
        >
        -- is a copyfighter. Sounds like we'd need to add an adjective to make
        the label meaningful. But what are the acceptible options?
        <em>Left-wing</em> copyfighter? <em>Right-wing</em> copyfighter?
        <em>Progressive</em> copyfighter? <em>Conservative</em> copyfighter?
        <em>Corporate</em> copyfighter? <em>Indie</em> copyfighter? When
        <a href="http://www.lessig.org/">one of the most compelling voices</a>
        on what one might think should be called the <em>progressive</em> side
        of this fight advocates "free culture" as in "free markets", I'm not
        sure any of these traditional labels make much sense.

      <h1>Surrounded by psychopaths</h1>

      <h2>7 June 2004</h2>

      <p>
        I saw the new documentary
        <a href="http://www.thecorporation.tv/">The Corporation</a> at its San
        Francisco opening day last Saturday. Overall, the film was excellent,
        though one image stands out in particular. According to the filmmakers,
        the contemporary corporation -- because it has the legal rights of a
        person but isn't subjected to any strong accountability -- is a textbook
        example of a
        <a
          href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oi=defmore&q=define:Psychopath+(or+sociopath)"
          >psychopath</a
        >: "characterized by absence of guilt and anxiety normally accompanying
        an antisocial act."

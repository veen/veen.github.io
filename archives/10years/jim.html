<h1>Jim's Story</h1>

<p class="lede">
I first met Jeff and Leslie when they came to Calvary. There was this talllllll man and this size 5 petite woman with the most beautiful long hair in the world. Not only long, but as she walked away with this imposing figure of a man, I couldn't help but notice the hair was cut exactly even from right to left. How does she do that?</p>

<p>I don't know what impressed me more -- the two together or her evenly cut hair.</p>

<p>Well, as luck would have it, I got to know them over the past three years and have learned that Jeff is more than a tall man, he is a man with a tall heart. He is so patient sharing Leslie with me. What is he talking about? I thought Calvary was a church.</p>

<p>Here is the scoop! Leslie offered to help me when I was just a pup in the Volunteer Ministry field because she believed this ministry could grow here at Calvary. Bless Jeff for being so patient when I would call their home and interrupt their private time. And for all the hours Leslie has spent in the office ensuring this process becomes a success. Leslie, I could not type an entire document and not use "ensure." You would have been sorely disappointed. And I had no editing help from you. This is all my doing.</p>

<p>Leslie has been here from the beginning when we would literally start and fall on our face over and over. So I thank Leslie and Jeff for being such a support for me. And Jeff, now that we are watching Leslie go to seminary (congratulations!), I will call at least once a week so you won't have ^ÓDees withdrawal.^Ô Since the phone grows out of my ear it will be easy.</p>

<p>Jeff has been a very important member of Calvary in his own right. He started and has
nurtured the Calvary Web site. I can tell you tonight, Jeff, that we have had at least six new members tell us that they found Calvary on the Web. Thank you for getting our story all over the country.</p>

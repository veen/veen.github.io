<h1>Leslie's Story</h1>

  <p class="lede">At Calvin College, where Jeff and I met, there is a ritual designed to
  provide distraction from the long, cold winter; it is called "Airband." I
  had never attended this festive event, but in the winter of 1991 Jeff and
  some friends decided to "play" a song. This group had been playing together
  in the basement of their house for quite a while so it only seemed natural.</p>
  
  <p>They chose to play "Living on a Prayer" by Bon Jovi. Since Calvin is a
  Christian college, this didn't sit well. Jeff had to convince the advisors
  that the song really wouldn't be offensive. Jeff poured on his natural charm
  and the group went ahead with their plans. Each member took his preparations
  seriously, including Jeff. He searched for the perfect rock star clothes:
  leather pants, a ripped T-shirt, big boots and a killer headband. But he
  decided that the look wasn't complete. It needed one more touch - big hair!</p>
  
  
  <p>Jeff normally wore his shoulder-length hair pulled back in a ponytail. This
  was much too tame for a rock star. The afternoon of the big event was spent
  emptying the contents of many hairspray bottles onto his hair to make it
  stick straight up and out. Finally, he had the look.</p>

  <p>That night when their group took the stage, all of our friends ran up and
  played the adoring groupies. I was among the crowd screaming and singing
  along with the band as they acted out their parts.</p>

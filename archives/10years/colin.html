<h1>Colin and Kathleen's Story</h1>

<p class="lede">The assignment you've given is a tough one; next to impossible, in fact. 
How do we, in short-story form, sum up the time in which our lives
intersected with Jeff and Les'.  We are having a very difficult time
thinking of a specific instance which would do justice to what you've
meant in our lives. The first thought that crosses our minds is of me, ten years ago today, standing with a shaking glass of bubbly in
hand, toasting the happy new couple.</p>

<p>So, in hopes of recapturing that old feeling again, here we sit together,
beer in hand, staring at our computer screen, wishing it was you. 
Sniff...</p>

<p>Okay, then, let's start with a stream of consciousness:  
- Buff and Wax<br>
- Smokes on the porch on Cherry Ave, 2 am<br>
- Jammin' in the sub-basement of the FAC<br>
- (sung ala Bob Dylan) Jeff and Les, Jeff and Les, going to Californya,
man, it's gonna be sad...<br>
- Great couple, great marriage<br>
- Smokes on the porch on Sigsbee, 2am<br>
- Les using Jeff as a prop-rod at our wedding<br>
- Les crashed back at the apartment, wedding day, 1992, 6:30 pm.  Out cold.<br>
- Smokes on the porch in Windsor, 2 am<br>
- Cock-roach hunting in Canada<br>
- Bad</p>

<p>Jeff and Les, we miss you guys.  We often Wish You Were Here, selfishly,
for ourselves.  But we couldn't be more proud of what you've done and who
you've become.  We are blessed to have had our lives intersect with such
friends.  We will always love you guys. </p>

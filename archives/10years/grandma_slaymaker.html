<h1>Grandma Slaymaker's Story</h1>

<p class="lede">
Leslie always brought her friends home for the family to meet and then they were always
welcome to come to my home and help celebrate holidays and special occasions. We liked her
choice of friends and thought she would get serious about one in particular but then she
brought a tall, lanky fellow home for the weekend and I wondered what she could possibly see
in him. I inquired about his education and what his plans for the future would be and he told
me he was going to take another year of college. I thought this was ridiculous, get out and
get a job and start earning money. Now I can see that there is something guiding him in a
specific direction. So you must not interfere with people^Òs plans, for great things happen
on their own.</p>

<p>I felt there was a calling in Leslie's life recently to make this change to something
worthwhile and a satisfaction of doing something to be a benefit to her life and be a joy to
other people. Who knows when the Spirit is leading you in a specific direction.</p>

 
<p>Leslie and I would sleep upstairs so we wouldn^Òt bother Grandpa and then we would look up
different passages in the Bible. Leslie was the first to find the passages. I knew right then
that I had better study the Bible a little more myself. Leslie was brought up at an early age
to believe in the Bible from her mother, father and Grandmother Ledyard. It was made clear
who would rule their home. I read this sign above their doorway many times while visiting in
their home.</p>

 

<p>It was hard for me to make a choice of happenings in Leslie's life, just growing up to be
the person she is today is quite an adventure in itself.</p>

 

<p>We are so glad she chose you Jeff and knowing you has made you handsome in my life.</p>

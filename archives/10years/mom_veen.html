<h1>Mom Veen's Story</h1>

<p class="lede">
I guess we know when our paths crossed...at 3:36 AM on November 16,
1968...so I'll just share a story that you've probably heard before</p>

<p>We lived in a duplex on the cul-de-sac of Sycamore Ave.when you were two and
it was raining..I couldn't find you and there you were, standing barefoot in
a puddle, in the rain!  When I called you to come in or else you'd catch
pneumonia, you replied,"  I not catch  'nonia, I catch fishies!!!"</p>

<p>Later, when you were three, we lived in "Ponoma" and had been to visit
"far-away grandpa".  It was late at night when we got home, and you wanted
fruit loops.  I was tired and said we had no fruit loops.  The next morning
I awoke to find you standing by the bed with the fruitloops in your hand
saying, "You say  we had no fruitloops!  We HAVE Fruitloops!" You can't fool
a kid.</p>

<p>I remember Jeff calling me from college and telling me he had met the girl
he was going to marry(you really had just started dating, I think) He so
sincere, I had to believe him!  My dates are fuzzy, but I think it was that
summer that we came to visit and called for directions, to be told it was
the house with a porch and a Lester sitting on it.  I think it was Beamis
house?, Jeff lived in the "Abyss" and there you sat on the floor folding my
son's laundry..(You gotta love her)Leslie, I remember talking to your mom
telling her how wonderful you were for Jeff as he was so Californian
laid-back and she insisted Jeff was right for you so you wouldn't be so
structured...</p>

<p>well, I can tell you both have been great for each other as 10 years has
shown...We're proud of you both and wish we could be there to help you
celebrate, but hopefully, we'll see you soon.  Have fun!</p>

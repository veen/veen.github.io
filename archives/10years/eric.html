<h1>Eric's Story</h1>

<p class="lede">Recently I was thinking about relationships and boats. Never mind the
circumstances, It probably had something to do Oprah, or a hallmark card
across the isle from the ice-cream cooler at the pharmacy, with its
sentimental proclamations of ships passing in the night; or was I drowning
in a see of interpersonal catharsis... never mind the circumstances, I was
thinking about boats and relationships as I looked out the window at White
Head passage, where Holly and I spend summer afternoons paddling our kayaks
to remote sand spits where the beach glass hunting is superb. We have our
style of navigation, which to anyone who knows us, is symbolic of our
relationship-me drifting and tacking out into the passage, and Holly,
steadfastly lateral to the shore. We have our eyes on each other, and
somehow, despite my superior speed, Holly always reached to the sand spit
yards ahead of me. We tried a tandem kayak once, in Tomales Bay. Inside of
ten minutes we had traded it in for two individual kayaks.</p>

<p>That was our first time on the water, 4 years ago. A group of us
were cutting across the mile wide stretch to the peninsula where we would
eventually camp. After a half hour I got my sea-legs. In a sudden burst if
energy I sprinted away from Holly in a childish demonstration of the
unsupressable male urge to go fast. "I knew you couldn't just take it
easy." Holly said as I paddled furiously towards the Big Yellow tandem
kayak a hundred yards ahead of us. I could see it was Jeff and Leslie
meandering around in the middle of the bay. They saw me coming, and I
imagined the awe and envy they must have felt as I bore down upon them in
my quick little one-person craft. They were probably wishing hey had chosen
independence over the that yellow barge they were sewn into like two baby
kangaroos on their floating, prostate mother. I could see them watching me
over their shoulders, I could see the big straw hat, that old lady's
gardening hat that was probably handed down from Leslie's Great-great
grandmother. At first that hat was all I could really see, perched over the
back of the Kayak. The back; the power position, what chance did they have
in that floating albatross with Great-great Grandma Leslie at the helm,
against me, the un-tethered speed demon of Tomales bay. I was going to show
them what independence could achieve, a little reminder of what they maybe
hadn't considered when they took their marriage vows.</p>

<p>And bear down on them I did. Inside of 3 minute I had closed the
gap to where I could practically grab that ridiculous straw had and hold it
up to catch the wind to tow me effortlessly beyond their bow. I was close
enough to hear them, and they, no doubt, could hear my deep staccato
breathing as I chugged vehemently toward them like a steam engine, full
throttle. They, no doubt, could hear me, and I could hear them, giggling to
each other. The straw hat turned once more to reveal, not Great-great
Grandma Leslie, but Jeff, all two-hundred and I-don't-want-to-know-how-many
pounds of paddling power. He said something to Leslie, like "that way" and
she snickered, and they were a hundred yards away from me within seconds in
a line so straight that two surveyors who happened to be on the peninsula
were able to calibrate their equipment by Jeff and Leslie's trajectory.
"Was that Jeff and Leslie?" I heard Holly ask, who was only a few inches
behind me after all. "Look at how well they can steer their Kayak."</p>

<p>Why relationships are likened to the ambling sports I'll never know. While
old lovey-dovey songs wax nostalgic over bicycles built for two, I'm glad
I've never witnessed Jeff and Leslie's prowess over their own two wheeled
vacation-cycle. I don't think I could stand the comparison I would
inevitably conjure up when I think of what would happen if Holly and I
tried to maneuver a tandem bike together. We wouldn't survive it, and don't
know many other couples who could make it safely around the block, heaped
as one, atop a spindly metal frame, wobbling and lurching, a
Three-stooges-like dynamo careening toward eminent collision at the first
crack in the pavement. Then there is Jeff and Leslie passing SUVs on Route
One in Morro Bay, Jeff in the back with his Great-great Grandmother's straw
gardening hat, and Leslie in the front watching the body language of the
drivers ahead of them, anticipating what they might do before they edge up
beside them.</p>

<p>Recently, Holly and I found two pieces of beach glass, well worn
and obviously very weathered, that fit together like two puzzle pieces. In
the world of beach glass this is as rare a find as there is. I think we'll
put then in a box and send them to Jeff and Leslie.</p>

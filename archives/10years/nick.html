<h1>Nick's Story</h1>

<p class="lede">It was the final day of RAGBRAI. We had finished the ride and were getting ready to head
home. A brisk shower from the water drums mounted on the top of the bus was the perfect way to refresh yourself before the trip home. The perfect thing in moderation at least, as
evidenced by Jeff's screams when the shower head let go and proceeded to drench him with an
unrestricted flow of water which apparently seemed colder all at once.</p>

<p>Most of us were rolling on the ground laughing. Thankfully (for some of us) Jeff had the
presence of mind not to run out of the shower enclosure naked in the middle of that peaceful Iowa town. To Jeff's relief, Mitch or John finally stopped laughing long enough to climb on top of the bus and shut off the water.</p>

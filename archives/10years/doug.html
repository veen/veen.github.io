<h1>Doug's Story</h1>

<p class="lede">Something I can think of recently - When Dave and Molly (two of our --Jeff's former-- colleagues
from the Lycos Boston office) were in town, we all met at your place to head to dinner. Jeff and
Leslie decided that before dinner we should head to the new bar that replaced Johnny Love's at
Broadway and Polk - I think it was called Rouge. The night we were there, they were unfortunately
doing some type of filming or photography for some local event or magazine or something. The
opposite side of the bar where we were sitting was filled with cameras, bright lights, overdone
decked-out models with tiaras on their heads, and maybe even a few drag queens. We stayed for one
drink -- I think it was there that I realized that Jeff also liked a good Maker's Mark Manhattan,
and that Dave could pound down a Scotch on the rocks like it was a shot glass. But the bright
lights shining in our faces were far from the atmosphere the place was trying to create with the
dark red walls and crystal chandeliers, so we walked out somewhat unimpressed. Anyway, on our way
out, someone who must have been a manager caught us outside the place and apologized for what we
had experienced, and handed us 5 or 6 VIP passes to come back some time - which to this day, I
don't think any of us have even thought of using... (or have you?)</p>

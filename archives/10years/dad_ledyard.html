<h1>Dad Ledyard's Story</h1>

 <p class="lede">Where are you when we need you? Mom's baking a batch of snickerdoodle
 cookies. Seems like those were one of your favorites.</p>
 
 <p>Been thinking about your anniversary request. I'm sure Mom is going to
 respond, but several thoughts have passed through my mind this week as
 the subject came back to mind.</p>
 
 <p>I keep recalling the picture from kindergarten or first grade, where you
 sort of looked like a deer caught in the headlights, with a short haircut
 and a lock sort of sticking out to the side. That was one of my
 favorites. You were a sweet kid.</p>
 
 <p>You presented somewhat of a dichotomy. On the one hand, your brother
 could tell you to do something, like sitting and hiding from Mom for long
 periods of time, and you would do it to a T, not letting out a peep. On
 the other hand, you would clearly dissect a situation, select the best
 option for you and resolutely stick to your guns.  However, you always
 seemed respectful of others, especially those in positions of
 responsibility.</p>
 
 <p>One of the favorites memories I have of your childhood relates to Al
 Widner. Having Mark as your older brother, I was accustomed to having
 teachers and principals wanting to talk to me about one of my children.
 But, when Mr Widner said he wanted to talk to me, Mark had already
 graduated and you had completed your freshman year. Since you had never
 been one to get into problems at school, I didn't know what to expect.</p>

 <p>Al proceeded to relate how you had taught him an invaluable lesson as a
 new administrator that year. In the 8th grade, Mrs Haughey had let Karen
 Peterson and you work at your own pace, getting quite a ways ahead of
 your classmates in math. As a result, by the end of the 8th grade, you
 had nearly completed 9th grade Algebra. At the start of the 9th grade,
 you petitioned Mr Widner to allow you to skip Algebra, going on to other
 subjects. Since it was a state requirement of all students, he declined,
 even though you offered to take the final Algebra exam to demonstrate
 your knowledge of the subject. </p>
 
 <p>You accepted his decision and took the class; however, at the end of the
 year, you returned to his office and told him that, even though you had
 "aced" the class, it had been a "bummer" and that he had cost you one
 year in your life (a little melodramatic) which you could have better
 used on something else. You urged him to give greater consideration to
 any similar, future requests which he might receive from other students.
 Because of the way that you had handled the situation and conducted
 yourself, his perspective was changed and he wanted me to know what an
 impact this had had upon him.</p>

 <p>You had a great amount of success in your youth with virtually everything
 you chose to do. One underlying factor was your ability to determine your
 potential proficiency and to drop those things that you didn't feel you
 would do well. I didn't disrespect that, but really gained respect for
 you as a person when you took up cross country running and stayed with it
 for 6 years, even though you were not the best and seldom even counted as
 one of the first four runners. Your grit and determination were
 admirable.</p>
 
 <p>We thank God for leading you & Jeff together. You seem to be great
 counterparts for each other. May the next 10 years bring as much blessing
 and happiness as the first 10 years of your marriage.</p>

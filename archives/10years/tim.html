<h1>Tim's Story</h1>

<p class="lede">As I think on the time that I've known the two of you, the thing that 
strikes me about our friendship is its ability to hold together 
across expanses of time and space. Conversations and experiences 
begin one place, drift, rest, and conclude somewhere else-- sometimes 
thousands of miles and months apart. Another thing that strikes me 
about our time together is that we're always skirting some 
narrowly-averted disaster in which the two of you find some way, 
remarkably, to keep your cool.</p>

<p>I remember certain small potential disasters we avoided together such 
as finding Jeff a bike large enough to fit his lanky frame so that we 
could ride together in Austin. Because, of course, when two cyclists 
*have* to ride, a missing bike is a minor trauma. Unfortunately, 
riding a bike that was too small for him just after back surgery, 
Jeff looked like Lurch on a tricycle, his face contorted into some 
combination of agony and glee. We made it home not too much worse for 
the wear, our minor disaster kept at bay.</p>

<p>Most of all I remember a particular fateful Thanksgiving holiday 
wherein we attempted to serve a new side dish over barbecued turkey-- 
"Chopped Finger of Tim". The conversation was good-- something to do 
with Jeff's love of Martha Stewart I believe-- and the two of us 
worked over our vegetables with ease while chatting in the kitchen. 
I'm not sure if things were moving along so well because we were good 
at what we were doing or if it was because of the new knives-- the 
cutting seemed to go smoothly, effortlessly. Either way I remember 
pausing the conversation to fish something out of the pile of onions 
that clearly didn't belong there. I think it's then that we both 
realized something had gone wrong, but I, for one, wasn't quite sure 
exactly what. Strangely, our conversation simply continued along, 
rather matter-of-factly, no doubt due in part to Jeff's practiced 
professional patter. Leslie had no clue what was going on in the 
kitchen, though I do remember that at some point she realized the 
conversation changed from spirited talk of poppy seed muffins or 
somesuch to the quiet talk of two men working intently over something 
as if they were hunched together in the garage solving some small 
mechanical puzzle. Even as I became woosy from the realization that I 
had swiftly and deftly flayed myself, Jeff remained calm, doling out 
instructions as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened. Noticing 
my pale, sweating forehead and missing limb, Leslie moved quickly and 
smartly and picked up the phone to call nurse mom to help save the 
day, certain death averted.</p>

<p>Despite our adventures-- and I'm a sucker for a big adventure, 
missing limbs notwithstanding-- what I value most about the two of 
you can best be summed up in your own words. After a long day in 
London this last autumn you told me, "we're 
What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get kind of people." You confirmed for me 
then what I already knew: that despite our continuing struggle to 
make our time and space coincide, we can still weather disasters big 
and small together. In the end there's something more fundamental we 
can count on, and that's what all great relationships are about, 
after all.</p>

<p>Happy 10th anniversary. I hope to go on knowing you-- together-- for a very long time.</p>

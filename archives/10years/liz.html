<h1>Liz's Story</h1>

<p class="lede">
These thoughts are mostly about my sister, Leslie, and therefore
indirectly a tribute to Jeff also, for his love, support, and
encouragement for Leslie to follow her dreams and to create new ones.</p>

<p>My first recollections of Leslie are those of a crying and cranky infant,
who I repeatedly asked my mother to return for a happier (and quieter)
model.</p>

<p>I jump forward a few years, to a little sister who was always tagging
along and wanting to do everything that I was doing, and at that time I
found this truly annoying.</p>

<p>Several more years passed, and I remember a girl who began to show great
talents, scholastically, musically, and expending great efforts to do
well with activities such as cross country running.</p>

<p>Next come great memories of Leslie joining me for her Spring Break, while
I was at college.  It was no longer a 'burden' to have a younger sibling
wanting to spend time with me, it was neat to have her around.</p>

<p>Soon she went to college herself, met Jeff, became married, and moved to
California.  What I wouldn't give to have her closer, to be able to spend
more time with her.  I have been able to visit several times.  She has
introduced me to several things which have now become my passions as
well, including a healthier lifestyle, attempts at exercising and
running, Jamba Juice  : ) , and most enjoyably - Kayaking.</p>

<p>I am very proud of Leslie, of her involvement with her church, her
leadership roles that she takes on - with great commitment, and most
recently, her decision to enter the seminary.</p>

<p>As I mentioned at the beginning, I am also proud of Jeff, for his support
and encouragement for Leslie to continue to pursue her dreams.</p>

<p>This may not have been exactly what you were looking for, but these are
just a few of the thoughts I had when reflecting back on memories of our
lives, both together and apart.</p>

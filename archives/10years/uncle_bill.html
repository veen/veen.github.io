<h1>Uncle Bill's Story</h1>

<p class="lede">Congratulations! Julia  and I have a tenth one month later, June 21.
We've been very interested to follow your careers, your lives and the near
misses (it's dangerous to walk and ride in CA!) Jeff has been a Beach Boy
who has worked his way North (El Norte!)  as a Web Site Wet Back who was
willing to do all kinds of back breaking and carpal crunching hack work for
the journalistic powers that were and are cold and hot wired.  Jeff's
motto: from Warehouse to Where else! And it looks like he has just about
exhausted  possibilities. What's Left?  To Write!  Another  book on the
Web,  and like a Web crawler, browse the world.  As the Bay Watch team from
Nebraska, we celebrate Jeff's accomplishments and realization of the
American Dream:  Go to California and strike it rich! Join the beautiful
people by the Bay, and bail out before the pink slips fly and the NASDAQ
falls.  Jeff has an incredible sense of timing and techno-chutzpah.</p>

<p>Leslie has had an equally interesting career and  unequal engagements with
cars and California traffic, running like a Marathon maniac all over the
Bay, even riding to work, traversing the Golden Gate, looking for her own
fortune by instructing middle schoolers in the fine points of Spanish
grammar. No money or fame in that game! Now, on to Seminary!  Not such a
shocker. Look at her picture on the edge of Grand Canyon and you'll see
Carlene looking back.  Mirror Image!  Same commitment to the less fortunate
and to Christian values. We are a bit concerned about her ideological
inclinations. Marti and Mary! A formula for  Liberation Theology and
Revolution!
But if San Francisco Theological Seminary is cool with this, then hey,
it's not our problem.  We expect , now, from Leslie a book. Something like
"Are You Running with Me, Mary (or Marti)?"  or "Web Design as Christian
Meditation."</p>

<p>Ten for you and ten for us. Where will it all end?
Good luck, God bless, and keep in touch.  Veen Vectors are are more
exciting than Bay  Watch.  We hope to visit you again  in San Francisco
even as you careen and carom around and off careers , corners and cars.
We'll just hang back a few lengths if  you don't mind. This is Nebraska.
We're kinda cautious and conservative.</p>

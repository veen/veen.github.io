<h1>Steve's Story</h1>

<p class="lede">Through the years that we've been married, both Kris and I have always enjoyed the time we've spent with Jeff and Les. There have been many good times to choose from but we decided on a few that continue to stick in our heads...</p>

<p>Kris remembers one beautiful evening up in San Francisco. We were visiting Jeff and Les at the time and decided to go out for dinner at an Italian restaraunt. Kris excused herself during dinner to use the restroom which, I assume, made Jeff realize he need to as well. Well, he stood up and walked to the restroom door and opened it. At the same time, Kris was leaving the restroom and nearly ran into Jeff. He kindly smirked and pointed to the sign on the door which read "Gentlemen". I don't know if Kris was ever so embarrassed, not only walking out of the men's restroom, or doing it in front of her brother-in-law. Les and I couldn't stop laughing after that...</p>

<p>I have many little things over the years to talk about, but that would take way to long, so I will pick a couple. </p>

<p>First, I remember when I was a freshman and Jeff was a senior at Ontario Christian High. (Can you see where this is going already?) I needed to fit in, I guess, so I would walk by Jeff and his buddies every now and then and say "Hey". One especially grim morning, I had just finished saying, "How's it going" when Jeff yelled out, "Nice North Star"!! This was, of course, referring to my beautifully formed zit in the middle of my forehead. I still (*sniff*) have nightmares about that...</p>

<p>I also remember getting pizza and "Good" beer with Jeff and Les at their apartment in Santa Barbara. Nothing outrageous happened, but we had a great time just filling up and talking about whatever came up. </p>

<p>Lastly, I remember a phone conversation I have with Jeff a while back. It was a little over a year ago and I had decided to leave the secure job I had been at for ten years. He had mentioned learning HTML and trying my hand at web design. It was overwhelming to think of starting out from scratch again. I remember Jeff saying that he had no idea what he was doing when he started and I think that gave me a little encouragment to pick up a book and start pecking away at it. Well, It has been a year now since I left that old job, and I am so happy I did. I see technology that truly amazes me and I also see how far Jeff has come since the zit thing. </p>

<p>Jeff and Les are so blessed to have each other. They are a perfect fit. </p>

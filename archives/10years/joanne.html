<h1>Joanne and David's Story</h1>

  <p class="lede">When you think about Manhattan, what comes to mind? Probably the 
  theater, the art museums, the subway. Maybe shopping at Bloomingdales, dinner at the 
  Russian Tea Room, tea at the Waldorf, or pastrami at the Carnegie Deli. Maybe  
  landmarks, like the United Nations, the Empire State Building, the Statue of  
  Liberty.</p>
  
  <p>When you think about Manhattan, you don't usually think about rugged, outdoor 
  activities. You don't usually think about...</p>
  
   <p>...kayaking.</p>
  
  <p>Jeff and Leslie are the only couple I know who would go to Manhattan, and go
  kayaking.</p>

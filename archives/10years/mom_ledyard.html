<h1>Mom Ledyard's</h1>

<p class="lede">Congratulations on this 10th year anniversary celebration.</p>

<p>Jeff -- You are the greatest son-in-law and the best thing that could have happened to
Leslie. There is only one thing wrong -- you are too far away!</p>

 

<p>Leslie -- When you were looking for a college to attend, I told you one in California was out
of the question because it would be too far away. So, you attended a college close to home,
but married this great guy and MOVED to California. My nightmare come true!</p>

<p>I am so proud of both of you. It's unbelievable to see all of your accomplishments and to realize that I actually had a part in your life!</p>

 

<p>I love you both.</p>

<p>Happy 10th and may God give you many, many more years together.</p>

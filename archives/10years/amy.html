<h1>Amy's Story</h1>

<p>Here's a little story from a little sister...</p>

<p>When I think of Jeff and Les together I think of a powerful team, a passion for life, an awesom adventure. I think of balance - serious and crazy, nature and city, work and play. And I think of two people who make living look so fun that you can't just sit back and watch when you're with them.</p>

<p>Jeff and Les, thanks for all the fun times shared with you in nature - biking across the bridge,
jogging through the city, hiking into the woods, kayaking in the bay, beach cruising on the board
walk. </p>

<p>As a little sister, I've watched Jeff grow up. Then I watched as Jeff and Leslie fell in love. I'm
excited to watch two best friends in love and learn how a successful and happy marriage plays out
as I embark on my own journey into married life with my best friend. You guys have embraced Chris
and I, invited us into your lives and have shared in ours. Thank you for that. </p>

<p>How amazing to be able to celebrate ten years of marriage! May God bless you on this day and in the
10, 20, 50 years to come. My prayer for you is that God nurture your marriage as the two of you
have nurtured me as a sister - encouraging, loving, supporting, protecting. </p>

<p>Also, thanks for all the hand-me-downs: from coffee mugs to VWs. Much appreciated!</p>

<p>Enjoy the moment. And raise a glass for the couple. </p>

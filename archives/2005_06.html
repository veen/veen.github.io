      <h1>Where's Tina?</h1>

      <h2>26 June 2005</h2>

      <p>
        My friend Tina is currently riding her bicycle all the way across the
        continent, from San Francisco to Portsmouth, New Hampshire. I'm so proud
        of her. And to do my part (while I sit on my butt in an office chair),
        I've set up a
        <a href="http://www.amoderngirl.com/" title="a modern girl"
          >dynamic map of the route</a
        >
        over at her web site. It marks each point in the itinerary and
        automatically updates daily to show her progress. Check it out -- she's
        almost half way there already.
      </p>

      <h1>Seriously, man, it's really important</h1>

      <h2>25 June 2005</h2>

        I saw

          >The Mountain Goats</a
        >
        for the first time Thursday night, and wow did they put on a spectacular
        show at the
        <a href="http://www.bottomofthehill.com/" title="Bottom of the Hill"
          >Bottom of the Hill</a
        >. They even invited Mr.

        and his guitar to the stage for a song or two.
      </p>

      <p>
        And the audience? Chock <em>full</em> of hipsters. I must say, though,
        they were considerably more alive than other
        <a

          title="Return of the trucker-hatted indie zombies | Greg Veen"
          >hipster audiences I've mentioned here</a
        >. In fact, maybe some of them were a little <em>too</em> into it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shortly after the Goats got back on stage for an encore, I stepped out
        to the patio for some fresh air. A few songs later, the music stopped,
        and out walked

        and

          href="http://www.johnvanderslice.com/html/2005_mtngoats/peter.html"

          >Peter Hughes</a

        themselves. Amped from an intense performance (or was it the
        <a href="http://mountain-goats.com/bio.html" title="The Mountain Goats"
          >crank</a
        >?), John yelled to Peter, "Hey, did we bring both whiskies?" (Fans had
        been showering them with drinks all night.) After getting only a shrug
        from Peter in response, John turned around (probably weighing the
        physical and emotional cost of playing a second encore against the
        benefit of retrieving that whisky), only to be confronted by a hipster
        who'd appeared as if from thin air.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Thanks, John! Thank you so much," said the hipster, who then gave John
        a nice long hug.
      </p>

      <p>"Hey, you're welcome, man. Thanks for coming to the show."</p>

      <p>
        "Wouldn't have missed it," replied the hipster. "Say, I have a
        question."
      </p>

      <p>"Um. No, I can't really answer any questions right now."</p>

      <p>
        "But, seriously, man, it's really important! You know that song with the
        line..."
      </p>

      <p>
        "No, I said <em>I can't answer any questions right now</em>." John
        motioned to Peter, and they rushed back inside.
      </p>

      <p>"But, but..."</p>

      <p>
        The hipster sounded panicked. He looked around in desperation, searching
        for someone to answer his burning question. He locked in another hipster
        nearby.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Hey, you know that song with the line about being in the living room
        watching the Watergate hearings?"
      </p>

      <p>"Yeah, man, totally. I love that one!"</p>

      <p>"What do you think he means when he says..."</p>

      <p>
        Now, while I'm sure this conversation would prove to be wildly engaging,
        I'm afraid their voices trailed off as I followed John and Peter back
        inside for more rock and roll. And whisky.

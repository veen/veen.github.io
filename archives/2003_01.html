      <h1>Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</h1>

      <h2>26 January 2003</h2>

      <p>
        I'm in the middle of reading Cory Doctorow's novel
        <i>Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</i>, which has been
        <a href="http://www.craphound.com/down/download.php"
          >made available free online</a
        >
        -- a gesture demonstrating a very smart approach to copyright and
        intellectual property. Doctorow released the novel under a
        <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>
        "Attribution-NoDerivs-NonCommercial 1.0" public license, giving anyone
        permission to copy, distribute, display, and perform unaltered copies of
        the work, as long as it's done non-commercially and he's given credit
        each time. Perfect. Perfect for a first-time novelist seeking to make a
        name for himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course he acknowledges the controversial nature of this move. "Yeah,
        there are legal problems," he says when introducing the novel. "Yeah,
        it's hard to figure out how people are gonna make money doing it. Yeah,
        there is a lot of social upheaval and a serious threat to innovation,
        freedom, business, and whatnot. It's your basic
        end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it scenario, and as a science fiction
        writer, end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it scenaria are my stock-in-trade."
      </p>

      <p>
        And the novel itself is quite good so far. I like this: "I think that if
        I'm still here in ten thousand years, I'm going to be crazy as hell. Ten
        thousand years, pal! Ten thousand years ago, the state-of-the-art was a
        goat. You really think you're going to be anything recognizably human in
        a hundred centuries? Me, I'm not interested in being a post-person. I'm
        going to wake up one day, and I'm going to say, 'Well, I guess I've seen
        about enough,' and that'll be my last day."
      </p>

        "Perhaps it is worth noting, in this time of imminent, useless war, when
        our country is being run by, essentially, a failed Texas oilman, that it
        might be about time to rethink our all-American, bigger-is-better,
        screw-the-environment, high-fivin', the-world-is-our-prison-bitch
        mentality."

      <h1>Sure, screw me over</h1>

      <h2>14 January 2003</h2>

      <p>
        I am frustrated by those instruments of evil known as "terms of service"
        or "usage agreements", especially when they render themselves
        meaningless in an attempt to grant the organizations they represent
        liscense to do virtually anything they want. Example:
      </p>

      <p>
        "WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE CHANGES TO THESE TERMS AT ANY TIME. YOUR
        CONTINUED USE OF OUR SERVICE CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
        CHANGES. ACCORDINGLY, YOU SHOULD REVIEW THESE TERMS FROM TIME TO TIME
        FOR SUCH CHANGES."
      </p>

      <p>
        How can agreeing to something that could change any minute really be
        considered an agreement? It can't, unless the agreement is, essentially,
        "sure, go ahead and screw me over whenever you're ready."
      </p>

      <p>I don't get it. Can't we do better than this?</p>

      <h1>Do you realize?</h1>

      <h2>9 January 2003</h2>

      <p>
        Do you realize<br />
        That you have the most beautiful face?<br />
        Do you realize<br />
        We're floating in space?<br />
        Do you realize<br />
        That happiness makes you cry?
      </p>

      <p>
        Do you realize<br />
        That everyone you know someday will die?<br />
        And instead of saying all of your good-byes<br />
        Let them know you realize that life goes fast<br />
        It's hard to make the good things last<br />
        You realize the sun doesn't go down<br />
        It's just an illusion caused by the world spinning round
      </p>

      <h1>Best of 2002</h1>

      <h2>3 January 2003</h2>

        has put together an interesting best of 2002 feature ("The Top 50
        Albums"). I particularly enjoyed their description of Beck's latest, Sea
        Change: reviewer Ryan Schreiber calls it "a searching crooner's epic,
        punctuated by paranoid, lovelorn poetry, and production radiant enough
        to illuminate the most minute details."

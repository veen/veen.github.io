        here before, but lately it's occured to me that I occasionally atomize
        my enjoyment of music down even further -- to the level of the "moment."
        You know what I'm talking about: that point in a particularly good tune
        when you're compelled to raise a clenched fist into the air and say
        <em>damn, this song rocks!</em> It's why I listen to music, frankly. I
        can't get enough of those moments, those times when you hear something
        that's just, well, <em>right</em> about a song. It's fantastic.
      </p>

      <p>
        And, of course, I'm here to tell you about one such moment. You know the
        band

          >Wolf Parade</a

          title="Wolf Parade: Apologies to the Queen Mary: Pitchfork Review"
          ><em>Apologies to the Queen Mary</em></a
        >. First of all -- <em>wow</em>, what an album. It's good. It's really
        good. As a friend of mine put it, "it's fun in a post-Modest-Mouse kind
        of way." And he's right. But, hey, do me a favor a sec and queue up
        "Grounds for Divorce". Ah, listen to that opening syncopated
        straight-angle guitar riff. Then hear it overlaid with those frenetic
        David-Byrne-esque vocals. Then comes the rising tension with some
        wonderfully silly synths and rolling drums. And then? Yep, there's the
        moment. The song's unifying low end comes barrelling in at 0:53, and
        everything just <em>clicks</em>, right then and there. So great.

      <p>Music is where it's at, I tell you.</p>

      <h1>I am</h1>

      <h2>6 November 2005</h2>

      <p>
        Overheard recently on 16th near Valencia, announced to the early
        afternoon world by a man with absurdly oversized gold-plated sunglasses:
        "I
        <em>am</em> the god who sees all things!"
      </p>

      <p>Yes, I love this city. I love it to death. How couldn't I?</p>

      <h1>Cold turkey</h1>

      <h2>13 May 2004</h2>

      <p>
        In a recent
        <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0512-13.htm">article</a>,
        Kurt Vonnegut demonstrates his chillingly accurate understanding of our
        present condition:
      </p>

      <p>
        "About my own history of foreign substance abuse. I've been a coward
        about heroin and cocaine and LSD and so on, afraid they might put me
        over the edge. I did smoke a joint of marijuana one time with Jerry
        Garcia and the Grateful Dead, just to be sociable. It didn't seem to do
        anything to me, one way or the other, so I never did it again. And by
        the grace of God, or whatever, I am not an alcoholic, largely a matter
        of genes. I take a couple of drinks now and then, and will do it again
        tonight. But two is my limit. No problem.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am of course notoriously hooked on cigarettes. I keep hoping the
        things will kill me. A fire at one end and a fool at the other.
      </p>

      <p>
        But I'll tell you one thing: I once had a high that not even crack
        cocaine could match. That was when I got my first driver's license! Look
        out, world, here comes Kurt Vonnegut.
      </p>

      <p>
        And my car back then, a Studebaker, as I recall, was powered, as are
        almost all means of transportation and other machinery today, and
        electric power plants and furnaces, by the most abused and addictive and
        destructive drugs of all: fossil fuels.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you got here, even when I got here, the industrialized world was
        already hopelessly hooked on fossil fuels, and very soon now there won't
        be any more of those. Cold turkey.
      </p>

      <p>Can I tell you the truth? I mean this isn't like TV news, is it?</p>

      <p>
        Here's what I think the truth is: We are all addicts of fossil fuels in
        a state of denial, about to face cold turkey.
      </p>

      <p>
        And like so many addicts about to face cold turkey, our leaders are now
        committing violent crimes to get what little is left of what we're
        hooked on."
      </p>

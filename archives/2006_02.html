      <h1>Measure Map acquired by Google</h1>

      <h2>14 February 2006</h2>

      <p>
        It's official:
        <a
          href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/02/here-comes-measure-map.html"
          >Google has acquired Measure Map</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        I won't say too much more now, except for this: I've had an amazing time
        (with an amazing team) designing and developing this product over the
        past year, and I'm incredibly excited for what's in store next. Here we
        go!

        were to write some crazy amped-up circus music? If so, it's your lucky
        day, because I'm here to tell you where to find it: just have a listen
        to track six ("10-1") on
        <a href="http://roguewavemusic.com/" title="Rogue Wave">Rogue Wave</a>'s
        latest record, <em>Descended Like Vultures</em>. The opening riff's got

          title="Carny - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"
          >carny</a
        >
        written all over it, of course. But if you listen closely around twelve
        seconds in, you'll hear the first traces of the beautiful insanity that
        slowly creeps in on the song over the next couple of minutes. And then
        at 2:03 -- well, let's just say you could stop listening closely for the
        insanity, because that's when it casts all pretenses aside and full-on
        <em>invades</em>. The resulting noise is pretty wonderful, particularly
        when it all falls apart and gives up the ghost at 2:45. Listen to that
        thing wind down!

      <h1>The future singer/songwriter</h1>

      <h2>7 May 2004</h2>

      <p>
        Amidst the hot hot heat and sun of Coachella last weekend, I happened to
        see part of
        <a
          href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=UIDMISS70405041641160971&sql=Blau36j2271y0"
          >Howie Day's</a
        >
        set at the venue's Outdoor Theater. His particular style isn't exactly
        right up my alley, but I was impressed by his use of live sampling and
        looping. While his band scrambled to fix some technical problem they
        were having at the beginning of the set, he played solo, just him and
        his guitar -- aided by a pedal-driven sampling/playback machine. He'd
        play and record a few measures of acoustic guitar, start it looping
        back, play and record another few measures of a different guitar part on
        top of it, start
        <em>that</em> looping back, layer some vocals on top, add a bit of
        percussion by tapping his guitar and looping that, and so on. Before
        long, he'd built an impressively rich-sounding song. And he did it all
        live in front of the audience with just a guitar and a computer.
      </p>

      <p>
        I know this isn't new -- I've seen beatboxers do amazing things with it,
        for example -- but I personally hadn't seen a singer/songwriter do it
        yet. I can't wait to see what this sort of performance technology does
        for the future of that genre, and for the future of music in general.

      <h1>Who makes your clothes?</h1>

      <h2>3 December 2002</h2>

      <p>
        <i>I asked <a href="http://www.patagonia.com">Patagonia</a>:</i>
      </p>

      <p>Hello Patagonia,</p>

      <p>
        I am curious about where your products are manufactured -- and, more
        importantly, under what conditions. Can you provide any information
        about this?
      </p>

      <p>Thank you very much for your time.</p>

      <p>Greg</p>

      <p><i>Patagonia responded:</i></p>

      <p>Hi Greg,</p>

      <p>
        Thanks for your email. We manufacture goods in China, Malaysia, Turkey,
        the UK, the USA and other countries. In addition, garments assembled
        both in and out of the US may contain parts manufactured both in and out
        of the USA. On our website, www.patagonia.com, we note which products
        are made in the USA under the "Details" tab on the product page.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for working conditions, Patagonia is a founding member of the Fair
        Labor Association (F.L.A.), originally known as the Apparel Industry
        Partnership. President Clinton convened this group in 1997 to address
        the issues you raise in your correspondence. Our Code of Conduct, a copy
        of which is provided here, is that of the F.L.A.
      </p>

      <p>
        On a more personal note, Patagonia's production team believes Patagonia
        products belong only in facilities that any Patagonia employee or
        customer would find acceptable upon a personal visit. The Production
        staff, in the course of its work, travels to every production location
        to manage the more traditional agenda of our business: quality, delivery
        schedules and cost negotiations. Through this process, we have found
        that only suppliers who treat their employees as valuable assets can
        consistently achieve the results we demand in these areas. There is a
        linkage between the two agendas that make it very easy for us to embrace
        both. In fact, we have come to view them as inseparable.

      <p>
        Health & Safety<br />
        Employers shall provide a safe and healthy working environment to

      <h1>Emerge vs. Release</h1>

      <h2>21 April 2005</h2>

      <p>
        I recently found something remarkable in the March 24, 2005 issue of
        <em>Rolling Stone</em>. Yes, that's the issue dominated by the fantastic
        Hunter S. Thompson tribute. But remarkable as that was, it's not what
        I'm referring to here.
      </p>

      <p>
        What I found remarkable was the short article in the "Random Notes"
        section that reports on a recent (and increasingly rare) performance by
        Fiona Apple. After describing Fiona's appearance at the Roots'
        pre-Grammy jam session, the article goes on to mention that her shelved
        album
        <em>Extraordinary Machine</em> -- or most of it, anyway -- has "emerged"
        online.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the article were to stop there, it would be mostly unremarkable. I
        would've just set it aside and picked up my computer -- to go find those
        tracks. (So let's just hypothetically assume I hadn't already heard them
        a few weeks earlier.)
      </p>

      <p>
        But of course the article doesn't stop there. It goes on to recommend
        that you "don't get your hopes up", because Sony has no plans to
        "release" the album.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don't know about you, but for me the distinction between an album's
        <em>emergence</em> on the internet and its official,
        recording-industry-sanctioned commercial <em>release</em> has been
        mostly meaningless for years now. Many of the new albums from the past
        few years that I really looked forward to were on my hard drive months
        before they could be bought anywhere. And of course I'm far from being
        alone on this. I've been to many, many shows where the entire audience
        sang along to songs that were, as I've said, literally months away from
        being traded for money.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, once again I have to ask: does this make us criminals? I mean, come
        on: all this music is now literally floating around in the air around
        us. What are we supposed to do -- <em>not breathe?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        That's right. The only thing a major commercial release really does is
        to make the ridiculous proclamation that you must henceforth pay to
        breathe. That's the choice they give you. Either suffocate, or pay more
        than you should -- mostly just to enrich a few executives who don't add
        any real value to the equation anymore.
      </p>

      <p>
        Is that what you think I might be "getting my hopes up for",
        <em>Rolling Stone</em>?

            One of the things I've noticed about the whole file
            sharing/pigopolist litigation thing is how the music industry seems
            to be shooting itself in the foot.
          </p>

          <p>
            The joy of music is not in the purchase experience (whereas some
            things are, otherwise why would we have "retail therapy"), but in
            the sharing of it. It's why concerts are so compelling.
          </p>

          <p>
            In "less developed" countries, music is a community experience,
            where people gather to listen or play and enjoy themselves.
          </p>

          <p>
            It just doesn't happen like that anymore, at least not here in the
            UK. Music is a managed, elite and costly affair. Where's the joy in
            that?
          </p>

          <p>
            As this exploitative commercial control of what we enjoy increases,
            all I feel is more and more resentment towards the record industry,
            and then they go and sue pensioners and young children because the
            billions that they make and distribute among the lucky few isn't
            enough.
          </p>

          <p>
            They're in for a hard time soon, and they have nobody else to blame
            but themselves.
          </p>

            I hate record companies. If they wanted $3.99 for a new CD with all
            the artwork and packaging, I would gladly give it to them. What I
            won't do is pay $18 for a product when the $1 or so the artist gets
            is enough to make said artist a millionare.
          </p>

            Assuming you *do* at some point actually buy the album, then, no I
            don't think its overly criminal. Too many people find these
            'unreleased' songs online and never pay a dime when the material is
            actually released.

      <h1>Finally</h1>

      <h2>23 December 2002</h2>

      <p>
        Finally, a company whose business practices don't make me immediately
        cringe. I recently ordered a messenger bag from
        <a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/">Timbuk2 Designs</a>, using their
        online
        <a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/byob/byob.html">Build Your Own Bag</a>
        tool. When I opened the package they shipped me a few days later, I
        found, along with my bag, a letter that began like this:
      </p>

      <p>--</p>

      <p>New Timbuk2 Bag Owner,</p>

      <p>
        Congratulations on your new purchase -- designed by you, built by us. No
        off-shore production, no sweat-shops, nothing but quality workmanship
        from the heart of downtown San Francisco. We stand behind our products
        100% -- so if our bag falls apart (yeah, right!), if it fails to meet
        your most critical expectations, of if we just happened to screw up your
        order, go to www.timbuk2.com, click on the Customer Service page and
        follow the instructions for returning a bag.
      </p>

      <p>--</p>

      <p>
        That sounds good to me -- especially in a time when many companies
        profit by exploitation and therefore want me to remain ignorant of how
        they supply the products and services they sell. That sounds good to me
        in a time when many companies shirk responsibility and make me take all
        the risks and send me through labrynthine voice mail systems when I have
        a problem.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sure, Timbuk2 isn't blameless. (For example, my bag is made of Cordura,
        a material manufactured solely by DuPont -- which isn't exactly a model
        for socially responsible bussinesses). But there is, at least, a tone of
        integrity, responsibility, and respect in their letter to me. And I
        appreciate that.
      </p>

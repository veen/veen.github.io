        <p class=head style="padding-top: 70px"><b>This isn't just another Web design book</b></p>
        <p>When I set out to write a book about Web design, I wanted to do something 
          different than all the other books out there. I didn't want to write 
          a reference manual for a Web technology. Nor did I want to write a step-by-step 
          tutorial or design tips and tricks.</p>

        <p>This book is a guide to help you <i>think</i> like a Web designer. 
          It offers solutions to the problems we face every day on the Web. And 
          it will give you the foundation you need to create smart and effective 
          sites.</p>

        <p class=head>Here's what you'll learn:</p>
        
       <ul>
          <li><b>Web Design Foundations</b> Good design comes from a deep understanding of the technologies behind the scenes.
          <li><b>Consistency</b> Learning from convention will make your site better.
          <li><b>Structure</b> Information architecture defined - from the Web's biggest sites to the simplest user experience to an XML-enabled future.
          <li><b>Behavior</b> Designing with interactivity and self-aware content.
          <li><b>Browsers</b> With so many broken browsers, you'll need a strategy for designing for them all.
          <li><b>Speed</b> The performance of your Web site is the most critical factor of its success.
          <li><b>Advertising</b> Being commercial is a reality. Is your site as effective as it could be?
          <li><b>Object Oriented Publishing</b> Harness the power of dynamic, database-driven Web sites.

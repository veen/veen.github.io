<h2>The Art & Science of Web Design: Chapter Summeries</h2>

<p><b>Chapter 1: Foundations</b><br>
The Web has grown insanely fast, but its foundations stretch back through years and decades of electronic publishing history. We'll look back at how intersection of traditional publishing and early databases influenced the way the Web was built. Why is that important? Because we need to deconstruct the basic philosophy of Web design: how the integration of structure, style, and behavior make up the foundation of our thinking about developing on the Web today. Then, from the philosophical to the concrete, we'll look at how that underlying theory applies to the technologies that make up the Web, as well as the collaboration of Web teams, and the interconnection off the people and the technologies they employ. Through that lens, we can look at today's Web interfaces.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 2: Style</b><br>
One the Web, style has a lot more to it than just aesthetics. With the advent of new browsers and new standards, the primitive visual capabilities of HTML may soon be a thing of the past. Moving forward to Cascading Style Sheets means not only a new visual language for Web interfaces, but an entirely new way of thinking about Web design. By examining the idea of "pattern languages" and applying the philosophy to the Web, we'll see how the notion of abstracting style from content and interactivity opens new worlds of design.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 3: Structure</b><br>
Judging a book by it's cover may result in a proverbial misunderstanding, but you certainly can learn a lot by simply looking at a printed work. Books have size and shape and page counts and paper quality. What do Web sites have that communicate their contents and functionality? The process of identifying and exposing these basic qualities of a Web site is encapsulated in the discipline of Information Architecture. This chapter will give you an overview of that pure blend of art and science, and deconstruct a number of very large scale architectures -- the world of Web portals.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 4: Behavior</b><br>
The Web is a medium of constraint -- designers new to the medium are shocked at the limitations they must face to practice their craft. However, the technology is changing, and thus the approach to how we put Web interfaces together is changing. This chapter explores how to use Dynamic HTML to maximize screen real estate and using typography and vector graphics as reusable interface elements. But most importantly, it delves into the biggest issue facing designers today: the shift from "pixel-based" design to "rule-based" design. No longer can a designer simply pass off a Photoshop sketch to some production assistant and ask them to make the page. Now, designers have to exploit the very nature of the Web -- that there is no such thing as a controlled user environment -- and make their designs react accordingly. Designers are creating rules for their pages, building in constraints and behaviors, so that their creations mold to the environment in which they're displayed. This relates directly to the discussion in the first chapter: Without a fundamental understanding of how presentational aspects of a solid Web product interact with the behavioral, there is no hope for success. Thankfully, designers have some time to make this transition, because it's going to take the browsers a while to catch up...</p>

<p><b>Chapter 5: Consistency</b><br>
It was a lot easier to design of the Web four years ago -- not only was the technology incredibly constrained, but we were designing for ourselves. Everyone who was using the Web was pretty much building the Web, too. They were smart and technologically sophisticated and we could build interfaces that assumed that. But, as the Web grew with such a phenomenal curve, the sophisticated users became the one percentile, and we had to stop experimenting with our interfaces and start building sites that were simple and consistent. This consistency couldn't just be applied to our sites in particular, but we had all had to start looking and working like all the other web sites, since impatient users weren't interested in learning new and different navigation schemes every time they happened across a new site. This "dumbing down" of Web design, though has forced us to experiment based on rules or "contexts". This chapter explains those how those contexts have developed and how you can exploit them on your site while still maintaining an edge against everyone else. Of course, there's still a lot of experimenting going on with Web interface design, and it's worth a look at what innovation we can expect to see.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 6: Browsers</b><br>
The infamous browser wars have taken their toll. Not only is the installed base of clients completely fractured between old versions and competing vendors, but each browser has it's own bugs and particularities. For the hapless Web designer, the outlook is bleak. Do I have to make multiple versions of my site? How can I afford to do that? Or am I resigned to a lowest common denominator version of my brilliant design ideas. This chapter digs into the reasons why the browsers are so different, how Web developers can form a strategy for dealing with this mess, and what basic techniques they can use to develop around the lack of standard support. Finally, we'll look at what we an do to fix this mess, and how the browser makers are responding.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 7: Smart Sites</b><br>
You've got three seconds to grab a users attention before they reach for the back button on their browser, and then 30 seconds to be done. That's right, no matter how cool and exciting that animated logo is, no matter how important it is to get that picture of the CEO right there on the front page, you'll loose more traffic to the basic principle of speed than any other. We'll start by looking at just how fast your pages need to be, using techniques such as the highly scientific Stopwatch Analysis, to peaking behind the scenes of your competition to see where they stand. Then, it's time to get your site into shape: scrubbing every last byte from your code, getting your images in shape, and finally -- borrowing from the magician's practice of sleight of hand -- dealing with the perception of speed versus the reality of slow loading pages. Think multi-browser design is tough? Try making a living at Web publishing. With ad rates dropping at an alarming pace, and banner clickthrough falling even faster, both advertisers and site designers are trying everything they possibly can to get the hapless user away from their task at hand and into a commercial message. From stretching stories across multiple pages to increase pageviews, to ad banners that mimic dialog boxes desperate for clicks, there is a harsh tension between usability and revenue. Does it have to be this way? The Web differs from other media many ways, but it's ability to collect detailed user information and target to that data is one way in which we can align the goals of both user and advertiser. We'll look at these strategies for making advertising actually compliment a user interface. Finally, we'll explore the practice of building User Profiles, a technique that can apply not only to advertising effectiveness, but building meaningful sites out from a strong publishing strategy.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 8: Object Oriented Publishing</b><br>
Remember when Web pages were simply text files on a Web server, formatted in HTML, and updated by hand? Trust me, those days are long gone. To build an effective and manageable Web site today, you need to exploit the powerful dynamic page-generating tools available today. From simple template based systems you can manage on your desktop to the enormous database-driven content management systems, we'll look at how the basic process of design and development is changing. No longer are designers building pages that illustrate stories. Rather they're working on creating effective interfaces that expose the power of content "systems". Much like the rule-based design we explored in the advanced interface discussion earlier, this chapter will focus on how designers must now cope with building templates for content they've never seen. We'll also explore the power of building sites from an Object Oriented perspective. When content is stripped from it's presentation, individual page elements become the basic building blocks of a site. Elements can be combined and rearranged in different ways, making maintenance a breeze if designed with a deep understanding of system from the beginning. And considering the cost of building and maintain web sites, this strategy might not be an advanced theory on the future of publishing online. It may be the only means for survival.</p>

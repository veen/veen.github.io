<h1>Object Oriented Publishing</h1>
<p><i>Note: This tutorial on developing dynamic, database-driven Web sites was excerpted from the book, "<a href="http://veen.com/artsci/">The Art & Science of Web Design</a>" by Jeffrey Veen.</i></p>
<p>I was reading one of those professional reports the other day from one of those 
  big research companies. The subject at hand was content management; specifically, 
  how large companies were dealing with the incredible flow of stuff that needs 
  to be posted to their Web sites. One interview with a product manager at a large 
  site struck me with the fact that they currently had over <i>100 million</i> 
  pages online, and were anticipating their growth rate doubling this year.</p>
<p>“Good Lord,” I thought, “that must be a nightmare to manage.” And, in fact, 
  it is. The report goes on to talk about multi-million dollar publishing systems, 
  with artificial intelligence-based metadata systems and other strange sounding 
  systems. It was enough to make my head spin.</p>
<p>Thankfully, most of us don’t have page counts on our sites with seven figures. 
  But that doesn’t mean we’re not facing similar struggles. Specifically, how 
  can your site simultaneously grow and stay up to date? How do to you manage 
  the flow of content through your site while developing new features, or redesigning 
  the existing ones? It’s a challenge anyone with a site will eventually face.</p>
<p>Through the following pages, I’ll show you a process by which anyone can convert 
  an existing site made up of static html pages into a dynamic, database-driven 
  site. We’ll look at how to uncover the structure of your content, how to strip 
  that content naked and then push it through templates, and finally how this 
  process is fundamentally changing how we design Web sites.</p>
<p>And remember: size doesn’t matter. These principles apply to sites that have 
  100 pages to sites that have a million. In fact, the example we’ll use is a 
  site for a small, non-profit organization.</p>
<p>So let’s roll up our sleeves and get to it.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>I've spoken to a number of Web designers on all sorts of Web sites, and I've 
  heard a common theme to many of their complaints. They talk about working with 
  publishing systems or template languages in their organizations, but they feel 
  completely cut off from how they work. &quot;Oh, I can't change that part of 
  my site,&quot; they say. &quot;The programmers take care of that.&quot;</p>
<p>If there is one important thing you should take away from this discussion, 
  it is that anyone -- <i>anyone</i> -- can participate in the development of 
  dynamic Web sites. The distinction between &quot;design&quot; and &quot;programming&quot; 
  – or the even more disturbing nomenclature of &quot;technical&quot; and &quot;creative&quot; 
  --  is artificial. They are as intertwined as the art and science of Web design 
  itself.</p>
<p>I call this process Object Oriented Publishing. Dynamic Web sites are built 
  using relatively simple scripting languages. Even if you have never attempted 
  to write a line of code, you can see results almost instantly. We not talking 
  about compiling code or using debuggers. </p>
<p>For this reason, we're going deconstruct an Object Oriented Publishing system 
  behind a relatively simple site. I could have chosen a large scale commercial 
  content site, or an ecommerce powerhouse with a triple-digit stock price. Instead, 
  we're going to look at a small site from <a href="http://www.calvarypresbyterian.org/">a 
  Presbyterian church</a> in San Francisco, California. This site faces the same 
  problems as many others – with limited staff and resources, how can this organization 
  maintain a Web presence that can expand quickly yet still maintain a professional 
  and organized look?</p>
  <p align="center"><a href="images/calvary_homepage.gif"><img src="images/icon_calvary_homepage.gif" width="300" height="238" border="0"></a><br>
  <b>A simple Web site for a church in San Francisco.<br>
  Yet it uses the same publishing techniques as <br>
  some of the largest sites on the Web.</b></p>
<p>The site is not terribly complex, yet there are a number of pages that need 
  to be maintained by a staff unfamiliar with the peculiarities of building Web 
  sites. To accommodate the desire for an organized look and feel, the site was 
  developed using a series of scripts that run on the site's Web server. This 
  ensures consistency across the many pages of the site, while freeing the church's 
  staff to focus on developing the content.</p>
<p>One of the goals of this Web site was to act as a repository for the sermons 
  delivered during weekly worship services. Adding a page or two a week to a simple 
  Web site may not seem like a very time consuming task, but there are quite a 
  number of fairly technical steps involved – converting the Microsoft Word file 
  of the sermon to HTML, ensuring proper navigation and branding exist on each 
  page, transferring the file to the right place on the Web server, etc. In fact, 
  the church was facing the very publishing problems we faced at Wired Magazine 
  years ago – the same problems shared by most any Web site wishing to update 
  with any regularity.</p>
<p>Looking at how the church solved this problem is an excellent primer to Object 
  Oriented Publishing. We'll start with an introduction to the entire process, 
  then drill down into each part, using the church's sermon archive as an example. 
  In the end, it should be clear just how easy it can be to get started with a 
  system like this, and what the implications are for good Web design.</p>
<p>To start, we need an understanding of the process. Below, I've outlined the 
  basic steps to creating a Object Oriented Publishing system.</p>
<ol>
  <li> Strip your content of all formatting.</li>
  <li> Figure out what the pieces are.</li>
  <li> Store those pieces in a database (or something similar).</li>
  <li> Design some templates.</li>
  <li> Wire it all together.</li>
</ol>
<p>We're going to follow these steps as we develop a basic publishing system for 
  Calvary Presbyterian Church's Web site. In the end, we should have a virtually 
  maintenance free site that can be updated by someone with even the most basic 
  computer skills.  </p>
<h2>Naked Words</h2>
<p>Before we can even think about what the pages are going to look like, we need 
  to understand exactly what the content is. In the case of the sermons, the structure 
  of each piece of content (or the <i>schema</i> to use database jargon) is pretty 
  well defined. Each sermon was sent to the site's manager as a Microsoft Word 
  file with the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>  Title: What the sermon was called. 
    Essentially a headline.</li>
  <li> Pastor: Who wrote and delivered the sermon.</li>
  <li> SermonDate: When the sermon was delivered</li>
  <li> Text1: A passage from the Bible that accompanied the sermon. Not the actual 
    text, but a pointer consisting of book, chapter, and verse.</li>
  <li> Text2: Often, there would be a second passage.</li>
  <li> Body: The paragraphs of content.</li>
</ul>
<p>The process of identifying and labeling each component of a story is critical 
  to the eventual success of a system like this. In time, we'll be using these 
  little pieces of each sermon to design templates and create navigation. Think 
  about the pages on your Web site and how the content could be broken up into 
  little pieces. For example, if your responsible for job postings on a corporate 
  site, you might develop a schema like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Job Title</li>
  <li> Department</li>
  <li> Description</li>
  <li> Open Date</li>
  <li> Requirements</li>
  <li> Salary Range</li>
  <li> Contact</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, if you're developing an ecommerce site, each product page might have a 
  schema like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>  Item Name</li>
  <li> Description</li>
  <li> List Price</li>
  <li> Price</li>
  <li> SKU#</li>
  <li> Shipping Options</li>
  <li> Current Stock</li>
</ul>
<p>You get the idea. This is simply a process of defining the content you'll be 
  using at as fine a grain as possible. I suggest being as explicit as possible. 
  Write down all the pieces just like I did above. Think about all the possibilities 
  for the content. In the first example, could a sermon ever possibly have more 
  than two Biblical passages associated with it? If so, I'd need to make a note 
  of that now. Describe each one as clearly as possible, including what type of 
  data it is: Date? Number? Text?</p>
<h2>Thinking About Architecture</h2>
<p>It's time to do some technical work now. We're going to take the schema we 
  just documented and create a database to hold the content. But before we do 
  that, it pays to take a quick overview of how systems like this really work.</p>
<p>You may have heard the term &quot;three-tiered architecture&quot; thrown around 
  in the past. This is simply more jargon for an overall structure of system design. 
  When applied to the type of system we're developing here, a three-tiered architecture 
  means something fairly specific: it refers to the basic components of an Object 
  Oriented Publishing system. Here are the three tiers:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Backend Database:</b> This is where the content is stored. Some popular 
    databases include Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase, and the open source 
    MySQL.</li>
  <li> <b>Middleware:</b> A server-based application that processes requests for 
    pages and provides a scripting language for writing templates. Some popular 
    middleware packages include Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP), Allaire's 
    Cold Fusion, and the open source PHP, We'll talk more about these a bit later.</li>
  <li><b> Interface: </b>This refers to the HTML code that gets sent to your users' 
    browsers.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm writing this on a relatively standard laptop running the Windows 98 operating 
  system. Also running on this machine is Microsoft's Personal Web Server (which 
  includes the ability to process ASP templates) and the Access database software 
  that ships with Microsoft Office. </p>
  <p>Rember, I'm advocating an entry-level sort of site building here. I want 
    you to experiement with the tools you have on hand and not get caught up in 
    religious wars over operating systems, web servers, and scripting languages. 
    But let me also reiterate that nobody in their right mind would use Microsoft's 
    Personal Web server and the Access database on a site with any amount of traffic. 
    Rather, you'd use a true network server, like Microsoft's Internet Information 
    Server 5.0 running on Windows 2000 with an Oracle database or the like. Open 
    Source fans would find the equivilent in the Appache Web server on Linux with 
    the MySQL database. Ultimately, the process for choosing the right pieces 
    is complicated and specific to every Web site. It's the reason why we pay 
    our Chief Technology Officers so much. (In fact, take a look at this <a href="javascript:MM_openBrWindow('scripting_languages.html','','scrollbars=yes,width=500,height=550')">sidebar</a> 
    for a quick comparison of a few of these scripting languages.)</p>
<p>Just remember: <i>Anyone</i> can experiment with dynamic publishing. This isn't 
  just the domain of engineers, database administrators, or any other IT professional. 
  Getting started is simple. The principles and techniques are easy to understand. 
  You can install the tools on your personal computer and appreciate how it works 
  from the inside. It will make you a better designer.</p>
<h2>Seting Up Databases and Servers</h2>
  <p>Let's get started building the system. Since I have the schema for the sermon 
    defined and documented, I can now create a database that will mimic it. That 
    way, I'll be able to store all of this content in a well-structured place 
    and know exactly what to ask for when I want to get it out again. Since I 
    put the effort into the schema, this will be a relatively painless process. 
    I start Access and create a new database, then add a new table (if you'd like 
    some definitions, I've included a glossary of <a href="javascript:MM_openBrWindow('db_vocab.html','sidebar','scrollbars=yes,width=500,height=550')">Database 
    Vocabulary</a>).</p>
<p>Now, I simply add fields to the table in my database. Like I said, this is 
  pretty easy, since I documented my schema first. I add each one and give it 
  the appropriate properties. One important note: I've added an additional field 
  labeled 'sermonid', given it a type of 'AutoNumber', and made it the table's 
  Primary Key. This all means that each sermon in the sermons table will get a 
  unique number assigned to it when the content gets added. That way, when I start 
  to put templates and pages together later, I'll be able to ask for specific 
  sermons by an ID number that gets automatically assigned by the database.</p>
  <p align="center"><a href="images/access_fields.gif"><img src="images/icon_access_fields.gif" width="300" height="216" border="0"></a><br>
  <b>Adding fields to an Access database.</b></p>
<p align="left">Next, I can start adding some content. It's very important to 
  strip any and all formatting from the text at this point. All I want in my database 
  is plain text – not Microsoft Word formatting, no HTML tags – nothing. All the 
  presentation information will be applied through a template a bit later. For 
  now, I want the content to live in on my database in as pure a form as possible.</p>
<p align="left">In the case of the staff at the church, they simply copy and paste 
  the content from a Word document into the appropraite fields in the database. 
  No need for them to worry about HTML or any other sort of formatting. They're 
  using the tools they're comfortable with.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, I happen to be running Windows 98. On the CD-ROM that 
  came with my system I found the installation option for Microsoft's Personal 
  Web Server. I installed it on my machine and can now serve Web pages to the 
  rest of the world, but more importantly, I can write pages embedded with scripts 
  intended to be run on a Web server.</p>
  <div align="center"><a href="images/pws_manager.gif"><img src="images/icon_pws_manager.gif" width="300" height="211" border="0"></a><br>
  <b> Installing a Web server is as easy as clicking &quot;Start&quot;. <br>
  I'm ready to build a few dynamic pages. </b> </div>
<p>Once the server is installed, using it is a matter of point and click. I need 
  to tell the server where to look for my pages, and I need to configure it to 
  know about my database. Both of these processes are described in more detail 
  in this article. </p>
<p>Once I've clicked the &quot;Start&quot; button in the control panel, I can 
  start building the site.</p>
<h2>Creating Templates</h2>
 
  
<p>Simple pages, simple code. Let's add a bit more complexity to this project. 
  At this point, I've copied and pasted about a dozen sermons from their Word 
  files into the Access database. Now, I can create a template that grabs the 
  content out of the database, wraps it in my interface and design, and sends 
  it off to my users' browsers.</p>
  <p align="center"><a href="images/calvary_sermon.gif"><img src="images/icon_calvary_sermon.gif" width="300" height="287" border="0"></a><b><br>
  By creating a template, we can pull content <br>
  out of the database and display it on a Web page.</b></p>
<p>I start the template just like I did the previous pages: by including my standard 
  header. These pages need to look like every other page on the site. But that's 
  where the similarity stops. These pages are different because they really don't 
  exist. What I mean is that I'm actually going to be creating what appears to 
  my users to be dozens of new pages, but will actually be just one template pulling 
  content from the database I created earlier. I'll explain this more by example.</p>
<p>First off, we need to open a connection to the database and ask for some content. 
  Each middleware package has it's own unique way of doing this. In fact, Microsoft's 
  ASP technology has a number of different ways to accomplish this. Again, it's 
  important to remember here that the syntax for what we're doing is almost irrelevant. 
  What matters most is the overall architecture of this system. I'm going to create 
  something called a Server Object that will let me to the Access database of 
  sermons, then allow me to build a page with the results.</p>
<pre>&lt;OBJECT RUNAT=Server ID=Conn PROGID=&quot;ADODB.Connection&quot;&gt;&lt;/OBJECT&gt;
&lt;%
Conn.Open &quot;Calvary
Set RS = Conn.Execute(SELECT * FROM sermons 
  WHERE sermonid= 1
%&gt;</pre>
<p>The first line simply tells the server to open a connection to the database. 
  The &lt;OBJECT&gt; tag is similar to the one you may have used to include video 
  or Flash in your Web pages. The exception here is the &quot;RUNAT=Server&quot; 
  attribute which, as you would expect, creates the object on the Web server rather 
  than in the browser. The next couple of lines start the communication process 
  with the database. &quot;Conn.Open&quot; tells Access that we're after the &quot;Calvary&quot; 
  database, where the sermons are stored. The next line fills a variable with 
  the results of our first query. In this case, we're sending some SQL commands 
  to the database, asking for the following, &quot;In the Calvary database, please 
  find [SELECT] all the fields [*] from the first row [sermonid=1] in the specified 
  table [sermons].&quot; </p>
 
  
<p>Now I've got a variable (&quot;RS&quot;) full of the content I originally pasted 
  from my Word file into the database. The rest of the template consists of my 
  HTML with variables where the content should be. So let's get some of this content 
  onto the page.</p>
  
<pre>     &lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;&lt;%= RS(&quot;title&quot;)    %&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>
<p>Since the top of the page is already taken care of by using our included header 
  fragment, I can move directly into the guts of the page. Here, I've added a 
  headline (&lt;h1&gt;) and then printed the &quot;title&quot; that came from 
  the database. Now, when the server processes this page, it will substitute the 
  variable with whatever is in the database field &quot;title&quot; in the row 
  starting with &quot;sermonid=1&quot;. Notice how this variable maps exactly 
  to the fields I added when I created the Access database, which in turn map 
  to the schema I developed at the very beginning. In fact, using ASP, my whole 
  schema is available to me:</p>
<pre>     &lt;%= RS(&quot;title&quot;) %&gt;
     &lt;%= RS(&quot;pastor&quot;) %&gt;
     &lt;%= RS(&quot;sermondate&quot;) %&gt;
     &lt;%= RS(&quot;text1&quot;) %&gt;
     &lt;%= RS(&quot;text2&quot;) %&gt;
     &lt;%= RS(&quot;body&quot;) %&gt;</pre> 
<p>So the rest of the page is easy:</p>
<pre>     &lt;div class=&quot;pastor&quot;&gt;&lt;%  = RS(&quot;pastor&quot;) %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;div class=&quot;sermondate&quot;&gt;&lt;% = RS(&quot;sermondate&quot;) %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;div class=&quot;text1&quot;&gt;&lt;%= RS(&quot;text1&quot;)%&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;div class=&quot;text2&quot;&gt;&lt;%= RS(&quot;text2&quot;)%&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;div class=&quot;body&quot;&gt;&lt;%= RS(&quot;body&quot;)%&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p>This code is optimized for a browser that supports Cascading Stylesheets.  
  Each of these variables could have been surrounded by a &lt;TABLE&gt; and numerous 
  &lt;FONT&gt; tags. And, since I'm using a dynamic publishing system, I could 
  very well create separate versions of this code for separate browser versions 
  and simply serve the appropriate one. But I wanted to show here the connection 
  between my original architecture, the database structure, my template code, 
  and the interface code. Notice how well all of the different pieces tie together. 
  Just as the variable names match the database fields, the class names that reference 
  CSS declarations match as well. Since I was very specific in how my content 
  was structured at the instigation of the process, the whole system can grow 
  from a solid foundation. Good design doesn't start with page layout. Good design 
  starts at the beginning.</p>
<p>I'm not quite finished with the template, however. Since I have a complete 
  scripting language at my command, I can manipulate a few things to get them 
  exactly the way I want them. For example, the date coming out of the database 
  isn't terribly attractive as &quot;11/16/2000&quot;. A bit of code fixes that:</p>
<pre>     newdate = FormatDateTime(RS(&quot;sermondate&quot;), vbLongDate)</pre>
<p>which takes the date from the database and passes it to a built-in function 
  called &quot;FormatDateTime&quot; which does exactly what you'd think it does. 
  In this case, I've asked it to set the date in one of the predefined formats: 
  vbLongDate gives me &quot;November 16, 2000&quot;.</p>
<p>I need to do a similar transformation on the &quot;body&quot; content, since 
  it lives in the database without any tags at all. Since each paragraph in the 
  &quot;body&quot; has line breaks between them, I can replace (using another 
  eponymous built-in function)  them with &lt;P&gt; tags to show the paragraphs 
  in the browser:</p>
<pre>     replace(RS(&quot;body&quot;), vbcr, &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;)</pre>
<p>And on and on. I can change anything I like, or use logic (if…then…else statements) 
  to make my template even smarter. For example, if one the particular sermon 
  only has one Biblical passage associated with it, then we only need to show 
  one in our template. We can check and see if anything is in the &quot;text2&quot; 
  variable, and only show the surrounding HTML if something is in there:</p>
<pre>     &lt;%if RS(&quot;text2&quot;) = &quot;&quot; then %&gt;
          &lt;!-- No code here --&gt;
     &lt;% else %&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;text2&quot;&gt;&lt;%= RS(&quot;text2&quot;)%&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;% end if %&gt;</pre>
<h2>Designing With Code</h2>
<p>The example so far only does one thing: it pulls one pre-specified story from 
  the database and runs it through a formatting template. What about all the other 
  sermons? How will I get them out of the database? </p>
<p>First, I need to add a way to reuse my template over and over again for each 
  sermon in the database. Remember that SQL command I used to ask the database 
  for the content?</p>
<pre>     &quot;SELECT * FROM sermons WHERE sermonid= 1&quot;</pre>
<p>I need to replace that &quot;sermonid=1&quot; with a way to say, in essence, 
  &quot;sermonid can equal anything&quot;. For this, I'll use the URL, or, more 
  specifically, the query string part of the URL.</p>
<pre>     http://www.calvarypresbyterian.org/sermonDisplay.asp?showsermon=1</pre>
<p>You may have seen URLs like this before. They point to a server and a specific 
  page, but then follow that with a question mark and one or more variables with 
  values. Everything following the question mark is called the query string. Here, 
  I've created a URL that sets a variable named &quot;showsermon&quot; to the 
  value of &quot;1&quot;. Now in my template, I can ask the server to put whatever 
  it finds in the query string into a variable I can use on my page:</p>
<pre>     showsermon = Request.QueryString(&quot;showsermon&quot;)</pre>
<p>Now my template has a variable named &quot;showsermon&quot; with a value of 
  &quot;1&quot;. Next, I use it in my SQL statement:</p>
<pre>     &quot;SELECT * FROM sermons WHERE sermonid=&quot; &amp; showsermon</pre>
<p>And from there, I can change the number in the URL and automatically show the 
  corresponding sermon from the database. So if I send a user to:</p>
<pre>     http://www.calvarypresbyterian.org/sermonDisplay.asp?showsermon=2</pre>
<p>They'll see a nicely formatted page with the second sermon in the database. 
  And:</p>
<pre>     http://www.calvarypresbyterian.org/sermonDisplay.asp?showsermon=3</pre>
<p>will show them the third. One important note: In this example, there are only 
  three sermons in the database. If a user were to change the number in the URL 
  above to a 4 or higher, bad things would happen – most notably they would get 
  an ugly error. Well-written, robust code should always include routines that 
  handle errors like this, but I'm leaving them out for the sake of clarity in 
  this system.</p>
<p>Let's see what I've got so far now:</p>
<pre>&lt;OBJECT RUNAT=Server ID=Conn PROGID=&quot;ADODB.Connection&quot;&gt;&lt;/OBJECT&gt;

&lt;%
showsermon = Request.QueryString(&quot;showsermon&quot;)
Conn.Open &quot;Calvary&quot;
Set RS = Conn.Execute(SELECT * FROM sermons    WHERE sermonid=&quot; &amp; showsermon)
%&gt;

&lt;!--#include virtual=&quot;/includes/header.inc&quot;    --&gt;

&lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;&lt;%= RS(&quot;title&quot;) %&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pastor&quot;&gt;&lt;%= RS(&quot;pastor&quot;) %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sermondate&quot;&gt;&lt;%= FormatDateTime(RS(&quot;sermondate&quot;), vbLongDate)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text1&quot;&gt;&lt;%= RS(&quot;text1&quot;)%&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;%if RS(&quot;text2&quot;) = &quot;&quot; then %&gt;
       &lt;!-- No code here… --&gt;
    &lt;% else %&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;text2&quot;&gt;&lt;%= RS(&quot;text2&quot;)%&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;% end if %&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;body&quot;&gt; replace(RS(&quot;body&quot;),    vbcr, &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;)&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;%
RS.Close
Conn.Close
%&gt;

&lt;!--#include virtual=&quot;/includes/footer.inc&quot;    --&gt;
</pre>
<p>Reviewing my template, I find the following to be happening: I'm instantiating 
  an object on the server that lets me talk to a database named &quot;Calvary&quot;. 
  Once I open the connection, I ask for all the fields in the table &quot;sermons&quot; 
  from the row which has a &quot;sermonid = 1&quot;. Then I start putting things 
  on the page. I start with my page header, which I include from a fragment file. 
  Then comes the headline, pastor's name, and sermon date – which I've reformatted 
  to my liking. After that, I put down the first passage, then check and see if 
  there is a second. If not, I show nothing, else I print the code. Then, I add 
  &lt;P&gt; tags to the body and show that as well. I send two commands to the 
  object that talks to the database, telling it to close the connection. Finally, 
  I include a second fragment – the page footer with copyright and other information 
  – at the end of the template.</p>
<p>That's it. That's how easy it is to start building a basic database publishing 
  system. </p>
<h2>Building an Index</h2>
<p>If I were creating this project out of static HTML, I'd now have to take all 
  the sermon pages and copy and paste relevant information out of them and into 
  an index page. I'd probably want to show the date, the title, and the author 
  of each one. I'd also need to include the URL in an &lt;A HREF&gt; tag to provide 
  pointer. The end result would look something like the screenshot on this page.</p>
  <p align="center"><a href="images/sermon-index.gif"><img src="images/icon_sermon-index.gif" width="250" height="348" border="0"></a><b><br>
  A list of all the pages available, <br>
  organized as a navigable index.</b></p>
<p align="left">But this isn't a static HTML project. All that information is 
  sitting in the database waiting to be used. Or, in this case, reused.</p>
<p>I start with a very similar template as before. I open the database connection 
  and send some SQL asking for the appropriate content. Then I include the page 
  header and display the results. Only this time, the SQL is different:</p>
<pre>Set RS = Conn.Execute(&quot;SELECT sermonID, title, pastor, sermonDate FROM sermons ORDER BY sermonDate DESC&quot;)</pre>
<p>You can see that I'm no longer asking the database for every field. In my last 
  SQL statement, I told it to &quot;SELECT *&quot;, which means, &quot;All Fields&quot;. 
  Now, however, I'm asking for specific fields: sermonid, title, pastor, and sermonDate; 
  still from the table &quot;sermons&quot;. I could ask for them all, but since 
  I have no intention of using the &quot;body&quot; field, and since it's such 
  a large field, my page will perform faster by being more specific. There is 
  one other difference between this SQL statement and the previous is the &quot;ORDER 
  BY&quot; command. This takes the results of my query, which will come out of 
  the database in no particular order, and rank all the rows by date. The &quot;DESC&quot; 
  means descending. I could have otherwise specified &quot;ASC&quot; to reverse 
  the order.</p>
<p>The &quot;RS&quot; variable now has a lot of stuff in it. It's holding all 
  the IDs, titles, pastor names, and dates of each sermon in the database. My 
  template needs to arrange this data into a nice interface for my users.  To 
  do this, I'll put everything in a table, starting with some headers for each 
  column:</p>
<pre>&lt;TABLE BORDER=0&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt; 
    &lt;th&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Sermon&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Pastor&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;</pre>
<p>Then I'll start a loop that runs through all the results I got back from my 
  query, printing each variable as it comes to it:</p>
<pre>&lt;% Do While Not RS.EOF %&gt; 
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;sermondate&quot;&gt;
      &lt;%= RS(&quot;sermondate&quot;) %&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;/Calvary/sermons/sermonDisplay.asp?id=&lt;%= RS(&quot;sermonID&quot;) %&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;%= RS(&quot;title&quot;) %&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;pastor&quot;&gt;
      &lt;%= RS(&quot;pastor&quot;) %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;% 
    RS.MoveNext
    Loop
%&gt;</pre>

<p>There are some interesting things going on here. First, I add a line of code 
  that tells the template to loop through all the results until it runs out of 
  results, or &quot;While not RS.EOF&quot; (which stands for the &quot;end of 
  file&quot;). At the end of the block of code, I tell it to move to the next 
  set of results (&quot;RS.MoveNext&quot;) and the &quot;Loop&quot;. This will 
  create row after row of a table, but since I put this loop below the first &lt;TR&gt;, 
  only one header.</p>
<p>I'm still using the same class names for my CSS as before, carefully matching 
  them to the variable names to keep everything clear. Each cell in the table 
  now contains the replaced value of each variable. The result is a well formatted 
  table of contents to all the sermons in the database.</p>
<p>One final note of interest here. In the second cell of the table, I'm displaying 
  the title of the sermon. I'm also using that page element as the navigational 
  link to the actual sermon. To do this, I've included part of the URL in the 
  &lt;A HREF&gt; tag, and used the &quot;sermonid&quot; variable from the database 
  to generate the rest of the address. As the template loops through all the results 
  of the query, the URLs automatically are assembled to point to the correct sermon 
  in the database:</p>
<pre>     &lt;a href=&quot;/Calvary/sermons/sermonDisplay.asp?id=&lt;%=RS(&quot;sermonID&quot;)    %&gt;&quot;&gt;</pre>
<p>The system is essentially complete. All the sermon pages are identically formatted, 
  creating a clean and consistent interface to an ever-growing archive of content. 
  That archive is accessible through a nearly automatic index pulled from the 
  same reusable fields of the database I used for displaying the sermons. Maintenance 
  is a breeze. Want to change the design? A quick template edit updates the hundreds 
  of existing pages on the site. Find an error? Change it in the database and 
  it updates wherever it appears – on a sermon page, in the index, on the search 
  results page.</p>
<h2>Eternally Fresh</h2>
<p> The sermon archive on this site spans five years worth of content. But now, 
  the content of each page – regardless of age – can be redesigned or embellished 
  with an up-to-the-minute accurate feature. It is as if I was updating every 
  single page in the archive every time someone adds a new sermon to the database. 
  Of course, you <i>could</i> do something like this by hand, but the labor would 
  be prohibitive. You would literally spend all your time maintaining your site, 
  at the expense of creating new content and features.</p>
<p>Systems like this also have an interesting historical effect on the pages they 
  contain. If I decided to, say, change the background color of every page, or 
  use advanced scripting for a feature, or whatever, I would be changing <i>every</i> 
  page. The implication, then, is that the pages will cease to reflect the visual 
  design and technological advances of the era in which they were created. For 
  example, when I was studying history in college, I would scour editions of Life 
  Magazine dating from the late 1800s while doing research. Much of the value 
  of these sources was not only in the content of the articles, but the context 
  in which they were displayed. Advertisements of the day, typography from the 
  last century and other tidbits would add to the overall impression of the time 
  in which the article existed. Will we lose this value on the Web? Pages created 
  just five years ago already fail to render in today's browsers as old HTML elements 
  become deprecated in new standards. The advent of Object Oriented Publishing 
  takes this even farther, separating not only content from it's presentation, 
  but it's historical context as well. It's a tenuous balance between the efficiency 
  of dynamic publishing and the value of learning from our past mistakes and achievements.</p>
<p>And not everybody thinks database-driven template design is <i>really</i> design. 
  Some designers I've spoken with find it insulting to think that each and every 
  story in a Web site should be absolutely identical. Content, the argue, should 
  be designed based on what it says and what it means. Visual design communicates 
  as well as the words, they would argue. And I would agree, but there is a reality 
  on the Web that forces a compromise.</p>
<p>First, design can and should conform to content, but tools are tools. Users 
  learn how interfaces work, and expect those interfaces to work the same time 
  after time. Developing custom design treatments for story after story on a Web 
  site can lead to a disorientation as users are forced to pick out the particular 
  useful bits of an interface over and over again as they move through a site.</p>
<p>But more importantly, a dynamic publishing system can give commercial Web sites 
  an edge to survival. The Web is still young, and business models are evolving 
  as quickly as the technology behind today's Web sites. Yet despite the surge 
  in &quot;dot com&quot; stock prices and seemingly endless venture capital being 
  invested in startups, the fact remains that it can be very difficult to provide 
  free content supported with advertising. The cost of advertising on a Web site 
  is significantly less than what it costs to run ads in printed publications 
  or on television- two other forms of media that are typical free to end users, 
  with costs being offset by messages from sponsors. Ultimately, successful business 
  models will emerge from the chaos that is today's adolescent Web. But today, 
  commercial sites need every edge they can muster.<br>
</p>
<p>So go forth and experiement. There's an Object Orient Web site in your future.</p>

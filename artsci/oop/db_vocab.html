  <h2> Database Vocabulary</h2>
  <p style='
border:none;padding:0in;'>Even if you never create your own database, you'll likely 
    find yourself collaborating with someone who will. It's important to know 
    how they are built, and what the pieces are called. Here's a crash course:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Database:</b> Think of this as the container that holds everything. 
    It is <i>not</i> the program you use, even though people often misuse the 
    term (just as a word processing program is not the report you write). Specifically, 
    a database is the file a database program saves out.</li>
  <li>
     
      <b>Table:</b> Databases store their content in tables, and can have many 
      of them. A table looks similar to a spreadsheet, rows of information categorized 
      into columns. Tables can be joined together for lots of power. More on that 
      later in this chapter.</li>
  <li>
     
      <b>Fields:</b> Each individual intersection of a row and column in a table 
      is called a field. A field can be given properties like how much data it 
      can contain, what type of data is allowed, or if the field must be filled 
      in or not.</li>
  <li>
     
      <b>Schema:</b> The names and types of all the tables and fields. More generally, 
      &quot;schema&quot; refers to the overall structure and design of a database.</li>
  <li>
     
      <b>Query:</b> To get at the information in tables, you need to ask for it. 
      In the lingo of databases, this is known as a query. Databases expect <i>very</i> 
      specific instructions on what they should be spitting out.</li>
  <li>
     
      <b>SQL:</b> Stands for Structured Query Language. Made up of commands that 
      you can use to ask the database for information, or send other commands 
      to delete data, copy data, or do a variety of other tasks.</li>
</ul>

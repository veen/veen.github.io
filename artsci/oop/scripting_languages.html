<h2>Scripting Languages: Code by any other name…</h2>
<p>The ASP code in the examples on these pages are mixed 
  right in with the HTML that will eventually get sent to the browser. For this 
  to work correctly, the server needs to look through the page before it sends 
  it, and act on any scripts that need to be executed. In the case of ASP, these 
  scripts are set off from the HTML by using the angle brackets (much like HTML) 
  but with percent symbols between them. Thus:</p>
<pre>     &lt;% ASP code in here gets executed on the server %&gt;</pre>
<p>The open-source middleware package PHP uses a similar 
  technique, but replaces the percent symbols with question marks:</p>
<pre>     &lt;? PHP code in here gets executed on the server ?&gt;</pre>
<p>Cold Fusion sticks with just the angle brackets, but 
  starts every server-side tag with the letters CF:</p>
<pre>     &lt;CFTags get executed on the server&gt;And can take parameters&lt;/CFTag&gt;</pre>
<p>It's worth repeating, though, that when you get past 
  the various syntaxes for the various scripting languages, most all of them do 
  similar things. They've each got their own strength and weaknesses, but ultimately 
  they're all pretty much the same.</p>

<h1>Jeffrey Veen</h1>

<h2>The Art & Science of Web Design: Overview</h2>

<p><i>The Art & Science of Web Design </i>pulls together theory and practicality into a coherent whole. Written in the engaging and accessible style of Jeffrey Veen's countless online columns and commentary, it still maintains the authority of research and traditional design discipline. This book is written for the manager tasked with "getting our site into shape", the designer struggling to convince a client to spend the extra dollars, and the home page builder looking to break into the business. It provides the vocabulary for the job interview, and the ammunition for the conference room. It will become the one indispensable keystone in a library of replaceable reference guides.</p>

<p><i>The Art & Science of Web Design</i> is not a reference manual or even a style guide. Rather, it a mentor for Web designers or those wishing to be, whispering in their ears during those meetings. It embodies that nagging voice in the back of your heads while sitting at the screen pushing the pixels around, reminding that there are new rules and new ways to break them. It is the college English professor that not only taught you how to write, but programmed you to recognize and seek out elegant writing. "You know grammar, you know how to spell," she told you. "Now let's tear into the classics, let's scrape down to the deepest etymologies -- this is linguistics for the sheer joy of language and story."</p>

<p>The book is structured around the basic Web concepts that so often get only a passing mention in the reference books on designers' shelves today. Yet these are the very issues a skilled HTM jockey or Photoshop guru deals with each day. </p>

<ul>
	<li> How do we work together -- we've got marketing writing content, designers laying out pages, and engineers wiring all together. Is this the right way to be structured?
	<li> Do I really need to know HTML? Can't I just by a good authoring tool?
	<li> How do I incorporate advertising effectively in my site? Will we ever make a dime on all of this Web investment?
	<li> Everyone is talking about "personalization" and "one-to-one" marketing, exactly what does that mean when sketching out a site?
	<li> Our site looks great, until the CEO gets a WebTV for Christmas. Now our vacation is cut short while we rethink our entire development strategy. What went wrong?
	<li> There are so many new technologies vying for our attention. How can I ensure we don't commit our Web site to one, or get stuck designing 3D fly-throughs of the corporate campus?
	<li> We hired a designer, but he works in Photoshop all day and makes us build the pages. We're pretty sure he doesn't even understand HTLM. That's not good design, is it?
</ul>

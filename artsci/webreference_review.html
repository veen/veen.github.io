      <p><b><a href="http://veen.com/artsci/">The Art & Science of Web Design</a>, by Jeffrey Veen</b></p>
        
        <p><i>Reviewed by: Andy King, Managing Editor, <a href="http://www.webreference.com">WebReference.com</a></i></p>
        <p>Jeffrey Veen is on a mission to make the Web a better place. His
        latest book, "The Art & Science of Web Design," came from a need
        he saw for a higher-level view of Web design: "I looked around at
        what Web design books were available, and saw a hole in the
        market." Veen was Executive Interface Director for Wired Digital,
        and the man behind Webmonkey, HotWired, and HotBot's designs.</p>
        
        <p>For many of you, reading this book will be an "aha" experience.
        According to Veen, Web design is no longer logos and layouts, it
        now takes a multidisiplinary approach, with elements of information
        architecture, programming, and of course design. Veen says: "The
        line between design and programming is getting more and more
        blurry." The rare few who stretch beyond their comfort zones
        and learn these other disciplines can become design masters.
        Jeffrey Veen is such a person.</p>
        
        <p>It's a different kind of Web design book. Veen doesn't dwell on
        technical details, he guides you towards more elegant solutions.
        He provides ways you can find the best solutions (interfaces
        etc.) through the use of heuristic usability and pattern
        matching, rather than the tedious testing promoted by the likes
        of Jakob Nielsen. It's a new design philosophy really, a more
        fluid approach with "intelligent content that can figure out how
        to display itself correctly" created from dynamic publishing
        systems (databases and scripted templates).</p>
        
        <p>And Veen makes it look easy. Veen's final chapter on "Object-
        Oriented Publishing" ties it all together with a great example of
        a database-backed scripted template (using ASP) front-end to a
        church's sermon respository. He whipped the site up on his hard
        drive using low-cost tools, and shows how easy it can be to create
        a consistent look site-wide, lower maintenance costs, and easily
        add new "views" of your data. The benefit of separating
        presentation from content is that your site can more easily adapt
        to changing standards, and formats. Want a WAP feed? No problem,
        query the database with a different template, or even an XSL style
        sheet.</p>
        
        <p> The days of large static sites are numbered. Going to "dynamic
        publishing" using a database gives your company a strategic
        advantage over your competition, as you can publish content
        faster, and change designs and formats much more efficiently.
        Your site comes alive. For an outstanding book like this one
        I provide a summary for your edification.</p>
        
        <p>Book Summary: What follows is a summary of the book, by chapter:</p>
        
        <p>1. FOUNDATIONS - Good design comes from a deep understanding of
                         the technologies behind the scenes.</p>
        
        <p>The Web is based on ideas from the electronic publishing industry
        and SGML. Just as typesetters specified presentation in the
        margins, CSS specifies presentation of HTML's structure. CSS
        *abstracts* presentation from content and allows different
        presentations for different devices and formats from the same
        data. The Web is an interplay between structured content, visual
        presentation, and behavior (what he calls words, pictures, and
        code). This theme carries throughout the book. A good Web page is
        a blend of presentation, structure, and interaction.</p>
        
        <p>2. INTERFACE CONSISTENCY - Learning from convention will make your
                                   site better.</p>
        
        <p>You can exploit existing de facto Web conventions on your site to
        maintain an edge. Impatient users aren't interested in learning new
        ways of navigating your site. Your site is one of the millions out
        there, and certain interface conventions have emerged (link colors,
        page layouts, navigation systems, and visual hierarchy) that you
        need to follow. You are creating a set of internal conventions
        across your site, based on external conventions from the rest of
        the Web. Use Pattern language to help sift through the different
        interface possibilities. If you manage your users' expectations
        through consistency, those users respond. You build trust through
        consistency.</p>
        
        <p>Think Mac. Learn how one program works, you know them all. Same
        for the de facto Web conventions. Think of the basic rules of
        consistency as context. See an octagon while driving, you know
        when to stop. See a blue underlined link, you know where to click.
        He does say you can change link colors, as long as their meaning
        is clear.</p>
        
        <p>Veen talks about the three panel layout, and the "LSD" design of
        portals (logo, search, and directory). Like Krug, Veen says each
        page on your site should answer three questions:</p>
        
        <p> 1. Where am I?<br>
         2. What's here?<br>
         3. Where can I go?</p>
        
        <p>3. STRUCTURE - Information Architecture defined - from the Web's
                       biggest sites to the simplest user experience, to
                       an XML-enabled future.</p>
        
        <p>Information architecture (IA) is structuring content to reveal
        patterns in data, making the complex clear. Architects need to
        present these strucures, patterns, and relationships (through
        hierarchy, and emphasis) then create maps or blueprints to help
        people reach their goals through Web interfaces. IA's are
        matchmakers, matching the site's view with the users.</p>
        
        <p>- The Matrix</p>
        
        <p>Veen gives an example of this by analyzing three ad-based portals,
        Yahoo, Snap, and Go. Portals want to avoid the "single-dip" user
        experience by integrating content and services to create as many
        opportunities for cross-selling as possible. Veen calls this "The
        Matrix," where vertical content areas bisect horizontal services.
        The more destinations you have, the more opportunities there are
        to make money.</p>
        
        <p>- Extending the Web</p>
        
        <p>XML simplifies sharing of data, and separates content from
        presentation. Once a group has agreed upon a set of common tags,
        just trade schemas and get back to work.</p>
        
        <p>4. BEHAVIOR - Designing with interactivity and self-aware content.</p>
        
        <p>There's no such thing as a controlled user environment. You need
        to give up control on the Web, let go of absolutes, and embrace
        the relative. Move from a pixel-based mindset to a rule-based
        one. Good designers embrace the limitations of the Web, and code
        around them. Creating self-aware content (through scripting) that
        adapts to its environment is a sign of the best designers.
        "Designers create rules for their pages, build in constraints
        and behaviors, so that their creations mold to the environment in
        which they're displayed."</p>
        
        <p>Veen gives some examples to illustrate his point. Create "liquid
        pages" that automatically size to the user's screen. Get relative
        with CSS and em-based typography. He shows how to script auto-
        sizing headlines that match the width of the column below, like
        a newspaper does. "Good designers are harnessing the technology
        available to them and using it to encode the process they use to
        do good design."</p>
        
        <p>5. BROWSERS - With so many broken browsers, you'll need a design
                      strategy for all of them.</p>
        
        <p>Veen shows that "old browsers never die" and shows some techniques
        you can use to create multi-browser designs that degrade gracefully.</p>
        
        <p>6. SPEED - The performance of your Web site is the most critical
                   factor of its success.</p>
        
        <p>Study after study has shown that the number one complaint users
        have about the Web is speed, or the lack of it. Web pages just
        display too slow. And don't tell me more bandwidth is just around
        the corner, they've been saying that for 5 years, and they'll
        probably say it for another 5. "You'll lose more traffic to the
        principle of speed than any other." Veen shows some techniques
        you can use to squeeze every last byte out of your pages with
        CSS, and give the appearance of speed with positioning.</p>
        
        <p>Veen says that slow modems are actually a benefit to the Web, as
        "constraint propagates creativity." He says designers do better
        work when they are constrained by the Web's limitations.</p>
        
        <p>7.  ADVERTISING - Being commercial is a reality. Is your site as
                          effective as it could be?</p>
        
        <p>"There's a harsh tension between usability and revenue." Veen
        looks at strategies (targeting, personalization) to raise
        clickthroughs and create ads users actually want to view.</p>
        
        <p>8. OBJECT-ORIENTED PUBLISHING - Harness the power of dynamic,
                                        database-driven Web sites.</p>
        
        <p>This is where it all comes together. The distinction between
        design and programming has become blurred, it's as intertwined as
        the Web itself. "Building effective and manageable Web sites today
        requires dynamic, page-generating tools." In order to compete, and
        move at Web speed, you've got to go to a database. Veen's point is
        that *anyone* can create a database-backed, templatized Web site,
        and gives an eye-opening example to convince you.</p>
        
        <p>Careful planning up front can pay big dividends later on. He shows
        how server-side includes, and templates embedded with "middleware"
        like PHP and ASP can easily query SQL databases for truly dynamic
        sites. This "dynamic publishing" requires little maintenance, and
        gives designers a flexible way to display different views of their
        data. Highly recommended.</p>

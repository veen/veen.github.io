<h2 class="title">Gotta rock against something, right?</h2>
<h3 class="date">September 25, 2003</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>Ha - I love it! </p>

<p>Bands like Sonic Youth, the Donnas, Green Day, and NOFX are backing a movement called <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/newsarticle.asp?nid=18721">Bands Against Bush</a> to raise awarness with their listeners and end what they call the "struggle against a world of perpetual fear and violence bolstered by the Bush administration." Many are even contributing songs to a <i>Rock Against Bush </i>compilation album to raise political awareness before next year's election.</p>

<p>We might just see our fair share of tatoos and piercings at the polling booths yet. Cool.<br />

<h2 class="title">There is unrest in the forest, there is trouble with the trees...</h2>
<h3 class="date">September 10, 2003</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>Bush and his administration have not been known for their environment-friendly decisions. Remember his plans for <a href="http://forests.org/articles/reader.asp?linkid=8441">oil drilling</a> in the <a href="http://www.akrain.org/action/default.asp?news_id=157">Alaskan forests</a>? </p>

<p>Well, now his focus has expanded from just Alaska to the whole nation (the nation's 155 national forests, to be more specific). The Bush administration is in the process of putting into place <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2003/09/09/financial1237EDT0107.DTL">new forest management rules </a> that will make logging easier and will weaken standards for protecting endangered or otherwise threatened species in these forests. What this means to area plant and animal life could be devastating.  </p>

<h2 class="title">Pretty, Pretty Princess</h2>
<h3 class="date">September 09, 2003</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>I have a dog named Sarah who is about as high-maintenence as any animal could come. Don't get me wrong, she is hilarious and adorable. But yes, quite a princess, too. (Which is why my husband and I laugh that she is called Sarah, a name that actually <i>means</i> princess. She came to us a year old and already appropriately dubbed.)</p>

<p>She hates water and loathes blowing air - anything that might mess up her mane or blow hair into her eyes. Although she does rub fish goo all over herself when we visit the lake. Don't know if that's quite up to royaly standards. But it sure is funny. </p>

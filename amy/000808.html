<h2 class="title">How we scar our children...</h2>
<h3 class="date">October 30, 2005</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>Sophia is a big baby. It's not that she's fat. She's just bigger than many 7-week-olds. And because of that, she has the cutest rolls imaginable. One such roll is located just beneath her chin - her "meat beard", as my dear brother so lovingly called it. And unfortunately for Sophia, we have found that to be quite a catchy phrase.</p>

<p>One thing about infants is that they can't lift their heads for very long. Because of this, the area under Sophia's chin does not get much ventilation (her <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amyfrazier/57891891/">cheeks</a> kind of aid in weighing her head down as well). </p>

<p>Recently, we began noticing a funky smell every once in a while coming from our little girl. We couldn't figure it out. She was bathed. Her diaper was changed. But since she's quickly learning to lift her head on her own for longer periods, we were able to catch a whiff one day as her head was raised and her neck was exposed. </p>

<p>"Whoa! The meat beard needs some attention!" we noticed.</p>

<p>We have now learned to scrub even the most random areas on our baby. She's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amyfrazier/57891947/in/photostream/">squeaky clean</a> these days!</p>

<p>umm jon jon sophie will be very disappointed in the long run that you chose to abandon her so quickly not for her stinky dipers ( which she made) or the fact that she occasionally throws up on her beloved parents and friends ( the throw up also made by her) but for the simple reason that her parents make her stank up the place. YOu can't blame the girl. </p>

<p>Meat Beard!  That might be constituted as cruel and unusual, if it weren't so disgustingly true.  </p>

<p>How 'bout "Stink Neck"?  or "Poopy Pouches"?<br />
Just a few ideas...</p>

<p>Meat Beard would also be a sweet baby Pirate name.</p>

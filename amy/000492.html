<h2 class="title">Filled with a different kind of passion…</h2>
<h3 class="date">February 25, 2004</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>I saw the film <i>The Passion of The Christ</i> two weeks ago at a huge pre-release viewing for a couple thousand people at Azusa Pacific University, including a pre-show interview with Director Mel Gibson and a lesson from his media guys on how "you, too, can sell this movie to your friends and peer groups," filled with URLs to pass on and phone numbers to call.</p>

<p>I was initially really excited to be there. Excited about my VIP pass. Excited about the hype, to be a part of what I felt was the beginning of "a movement," or, as Mel's camp was promoting, "The biggest outreach opportunity in 2,000 years." </p>

<p>I can say honestly that I was put off before the movie even started. Lee Strobel, a well-known Christian author who was interview Mel Gibson, asked if he felt the movie really deserved it's "R" rating. Mel's reply: "Ooooooooh yes." Why? "It's two hours of watching a man being brutally tortured to death." </p>

<p>And there you have it folks. <i>The Passion of The Christ</i> in its entirety. </p>

<p>There is something to be said about understanding the pain and anguish that Jesus endured. I think it's very important for many people who have lost their way, who have forgotten the sacrifice. But there is so much more to be said of Christ's love and they way he lived life. The movie shows brief moments of humanity when, in flashbacks, you see Jesus as a boy with his mother, Jesus redeeming Mary Magdaline from a life filled with emptyness, Jesus washing the feet of his disciples as a loving act of service. But I wanted more of that. I <i>needed</i> more of that. I wanted a movie about the life of Christ and what he stood for. But I suppose that wouldn't be the Passion. I guess I just wanted a different kind of passion. Passion that leaves me with hope, not with guilt and anger.</p>

<p>One of my favorite columnists, <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2004/02/25/notes022504.DTL">Mark Morford</a> from the SFGate, is not religious, and I don't think he's even seen (or will see) the movie. But maybe he touches on something here that we'd be wise to explore: "You can think you need to have your spiritual belief coated in gallons of blood and death and grisly sacrifice and really bitchin' cinematography, of cruel beatings and nightmarish tortures and gruesome crucifixions…or, you know, you don't. Jesus, rumor has it, didn't die for sin. He died for enlightenment. He didn't die so people would walk around all day in ugly nail necklaces thinking about bloody violent death, swapping quote cards and thinking they know something of the divine. He died to indicate humanity's need to purge itself of hate, war, violence and ego -- you know, all those things now performed in his name."<br />

<p>I haven't seen the film, so for what it's worth here goes.</p>

<p>I just think that the notion of coming to consciousness/enlightenment without pain or suffering is true. Was it Jung who said that? And the emotions of sympathy and empathy often open our hearts to truly know what love is.</p>

<p>Again, haven't seen the flick. But I think this may have been the point...learn to see love by learning about the sacrifice...not focusing on the sacrifice later. Don't we feel horrible for the survivors of the Holocust after seeing Schindler's List? We have a new-found respect and sympathy through learning their pain. But we wouldn't just say "yea all that dying and torture is fine, but what we need to focus on here is the love. How enlightened we all are now that it's happened."</p>

<p>I dunno. My 2cents.</p>

<p>Too bad you saw fit to quote a crank like Morford approvingly.  But hey, I don't live in SF, so I guess I'm just a slack-jawed fundamentalist.</p>

<p>I have to agree with Stoddart that Morford isn't an excellent example of what Christian living is about.  He IS, however, a perfect representation of my non-Christian friends and their views and attitudes.  I think his "review" puts into an interesting light the whole "The Best Outreach Opportunity in 2000 Years" slogan that's been pushed along with the film.  Maybe we're just so out of touch with what it was like before we found Jesus that we can't view the film with those eyes.  Maybe that's a good thing.  Maybe it's not.</p>

<p>this is the first place that i have decided to give comment on the film.  although i haven't seen it yet, saturday, i know that i don't have to see it to make this comment.</p>

<p>i think that is an important point, but not the only point, to remember that Jesus was born to die.  Born to die for our sins.  </p>

<p>Now with that said, it was his perfect life of love and sinlessness that allowed that death to happen in the first place.  But it still remains important to realize, regardless of what you acutally confess to believe, "One of the most important of the many reasons given in the Bible why Jesus had to die was to receive the wrath of God in the place of others.  Romans 3:23 'For all have sinned.'  And because God is just and holy, He must punish those who have sinned.  But because He is also so loving, He was willing to send His son Jesus to take the hammer blow of His wrath so that others might receive His mercy."  -Don Whitney, Kansas City (BP).</p>

<p>At the moment of the Passion, all of God's wrath for sin was release on His son Jesus.  "All of God's wrath" has got to be a pretty horrific sight when it is released upon a human.</p>

<p>So to sum up my comments,  without first accepting how and why Jesus died I find it difficult, if not impossible, to truly understand His love for us and the hope that His death provided for us.</p>

<p>So Amy, I think that is where we can find the Passion that we seek in our daily walk.  From what I have read about you, you are already a Christian.  Mel most likely has created this movie for the nonbeliever first and us second.</p>

<p>Ching, Ching...</p>

<p>I haven't seen the film yet, either, and am hoping to avoid the circus atmosphere and watch it on my own when it comes out on (widescreen! anamorphic! Dolby 5.1!) DVD in a few months. But I did write a bit about my unease here: <a href="http://www.consolationchamps.com/archives/001057.html#001057" rel="nofollow">http://www.consolationchamps.com/archives/001057.html#001057</a></p>

<p>I liked what you wrote. Films about Jesus' life and teachings, though, don't "sell"...</p>

<p>i have seen the movie. never in my life have i willing sat through something so incredibly horrific and painful. the oddest thing to me though, was not the movie itself... but the reaction of the audience. there was no talking durring this movie...no cell phones ringing.... no pagers paging....no crunching of popcorn or slurping of soda....no one left to go to the restroom...no one left before the credits ended and the lights came on...there was no talking from the seats to the doors to the cars...except for the occassional sobbing... there was only silence. <br />
i have always known that God loved me. i have always known that Jesus died for me. but until i saw this movie...any idea i may have had of what he did and continues to do for me...doesn't even scatch the surface. how can anyone NOT accept Christ? how can we NOT live for him? <br />
how much money anyone does or does not make from this is irrelevant. because there is no way you can walk out of this movie without being changed in some way. people will see and know the truth through this. </p>

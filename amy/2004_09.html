<h2 class="title">Typical Conversation with Chris as I’m drifting off to sleep...</h2>
<h3 class="date">September 22, 2004</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>Chris: Are you awake? I just thought of something really cool.<br />
Me: Um, yeah…I guess.<br />
C: Good thing our bed has these cool wooden slats on the headboard.<br />
M: (Thinking this is going somewhere bad.)<br />
C: Because that way if gravity ever, you know, stopped working someday we could grab onto them and save ourselves from flying into space.<br />
M: Goodnight.<br />

<h2 class="title">Mohr of that comedy!</h2>
<h3 class="date">September 17, 2004</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>I just recently finished reading Jay Mohr's new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1401300065/102-5758430-1306530?v=glance"><i>Gasping for Airtime : Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live</i></a>, and I couldn't stop laughing. For those of you who are already Mohr fans, this book is a hilarious and also dark look into Jay's life during his two years on <i>SNL</i>. The thing that's so great is that this was back in the 90s when <i>SNL</i> was in the height of its comedy. Not the glory days of Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase. But the revival with Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, Phil Hartman and Mike Meyers. I can remember watching every Saturday night with my friends and then beating the jokes to death for days (or months afterward) - even moreso than the comedians on <i>SNL</i> ever could (if that's possible)!</p>

<p>Many times the book was merely a tribute to Chris Farley and to Mohr's immense joy at just being around him and watching him live. Regardless, those parts will make you laugh out loud (if you have a pulse). It's a fun way to get an insider's look into one of the longest running shows ever and the craziness and stress that ensues every week to make <i>Saturday Night Live</i> happen.  </p>

</div>My brother Greg went to Burning Man again this year. Every year seems to be about how to top the last year. Besides his pink fauxhawk, I think he trumped everyone by far with his cool neon bike tank o' passion. Look out Osama - you're gonna get LOOOOOOOVED!

<h2 class="title">A whole lot of firsts...</h2>
<h3 class="date">September 18, 2005</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>I haven't posted in a while because of an overwhelming number of "firsts" I experienced this past week. Unfortunately last Wednesday, as I was healing from childbirth only a week earlier, I experience some major bleeding and had to be rushed back to the hospital - this time by ambulance (one major first) to the ER (another major first). This was a pretty scary experience, and definitely one I would rather not have to endure again. But as Chris says, "As easy as Amy's delivery was, she has officially earned our little one many times over." No kidding.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us, we have amazing family and friends who jumped in at moment's notice to lend a hand. Grandmas and Aunties were there to take care of Sophia so that Chris was able to get to the hospital not long after me. </p>

<p>My ER experience was horrible, but I had my husband and my mom there for the crucial parts, which  made it more bearable. And then I was rushed to surgery (again, another major first for me) to remove extra particles that were left inside me from my labor and delivery. I recovered in the maternity ward for a couple days and was finally able to come home on Friday night. </p>

<p>Needless to say, I'm exhausted but very thankful to be home with my husband and my little girl. I missed her a lot, considering I had to leave her after only a week of bonding! But it took no time at all for the two of us to pick up where we left off. </p>

<p>Now we're back to figuring out life again and getting me healthy and healed. I've still got a lot of questions about everything that went down, but I'm going to be seeking out answers over the next week with my doctors and trying to make sense of everything.</p>

<p>Please keep our family in your thoughts and prayers if you think of it, as we feel like we're kind of back at the beginning. We definitely appreciate it!</p>

<p>I am SO sorry Amy, I can only imagine how scary it must have been! You, Chris and Sophie are in my prayers. Hope you are feeling totally healed really soon, and that they are able to answer all of your questions. Thinking of you! :o)</p>

<p>If you weren't running out of time trying to keep up with your Friendster and Tickle accounts, or all your buddy lists on MSN, AIM and Yahoo, now you have to do it for your dog, too! </p>

<p>Of course, in the 21st century, my dog Sarah would <i>have </i>to be as tech savvy as the next dog. Check out her <a href="http://www.dogster.com/?59236">own personal website</a> at Dogster. Once she figures out the keyboard (the lack of opposable thumbs is killing her on the space bar), I'm sure she'll be blogging soon, too.</p>

<h2 class="title">Now that's what I'm talking about...</h2>
<h3 class="date">August 11, 2004</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>If you live anywhere near California, you probably have tried the best burgers and fries ever made. Of course I'm referring to In-N-Out Burger, the franchise that has retained the same menu for pretty much the entirety of its tenure. And almost the same prices, too. </p>

<p>Chris and I were craving the goods the other night and decided to head on over. But since In-N-Out is always good, it’s also always busy. As we sat in one of the two drive-thru lines debating whether we chose the "best" one, we quickly realized we hadn't. The man several cars ahead was waiting on an enormous order and Chris and I decided it was due time that drive-thru restaurants came up with a system to make the waiting more fun.</p>

<p>Some ideas:<br />
    - have buttons stationed near the cars in line that, when pushed, trigger a stream of water into the window of the car causing the long wait. These buttons would be similar is style to the ones you press to fill the clowns mouth or move your motorcycle across the board the fastest at a carnival. That way, anyone who took too long could get the water-in-the-face gag and all the others waiting could have a nice laugh. Actually, anything carnival-style could probably make this list.</p>

<p>    - have all orders appear on a huge neon sign for the waiting cars to see. Not only could this possibly help you in deciding what to order, it will help you choose which line to enter (Note: this would only work at the In-N-Outs that let you order on both sides of the little shack. But I think the voyeristic quality is enough to get this idea to stick.)</p>

<p>    - give out samples while you wait.</p>

<p>    - play John Hughes movies!<br />

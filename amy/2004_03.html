<h2 class="title">Building Something Cool</h2>
<h3 class="date">March 29, 2004</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>Friday we went down to Carlsbad for one leg of Chris' 5-day birthday celebration. Hey, you only turn 30 once, right? One of the main things that brought us down there (besides his mom's gorgeous time share) was <a href="http://www.lego.com/legoland/california/default.asp?locale=2057">LEGOLAND</a>. This is seriously one of the coolest places to hang out as an adult if you grew up with a tub of Legos in your house as a kid. </p>

<p>The best thing about the park is the huge emphasis on interaction. On most of the rides you literally have to use manpower to make them go. There is a pulley ride where you control when you are released and a self-pedaled roller coaster ride. And almost everywhere you turn there is that same tub of Legos calling you to build a new masterpiece.</p>

<p>But the main attraction was Miniland – various cities in the United States made completely out of Legos. They had Coit Tower and the Embarcadero in San Francisoco (and even Lego seals down at the pier!). There was the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles and Grand Central Station and Central Park in New York. They even had a Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans and the White House in D.C. with Secret Service Lego guys on top. </p>

<p>We thought Legos were cool before, but this trip definitely confirmed it.</p>

<h2 class="title">A refreshing breath</h2>
<h3 class="date">March 15, 2004</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>I think in the midst of the craziness that defines this time of year, I had almost forgotten to enjoy the coming of spring (even though, in all honesty, it's pretty much here already). For some reason, every year March tends to be the busiest month for me. It just flies by and is always filled with so many deadlines. Adding to that, this year I am planning a wedding shower for my best friend, a 30th-birthday wine tasting party for my husband, and a whole slew of fundraising events for work (I do development and fundraising for a <a href="http://www.ettielee.org">non-profit</a> that supports foster children and at-risk youth), and you can see why my face hasn't seen the light of day for some time. It's right about now that I wonder why I decided to give up caffeine for Lent this year.</p>

<p>So yesterday, after a 3-hour nap (wow!), I lied around and finished my novel for this month's book club – <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061097314/qid=1079377061/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/102-0346319-6273724">The Bean Trees</a></i>, by Barbara Kingsolver, chilled with my dog outside enjoying the amazing Southern California weather, and caught up on <i>way </i>too much pre-recorded TV. </p>

<p>Don't you just love lazy Sundays?<br />

<h2 class="title">Yee-Haw, Cowboy!</h2>
<h3 class="date">October 07, 2003</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>I will admit it in public. I went to a rodeo this weekend. Yep, the San Dimas rodeo, no less. So close to home it's scary. (Seriously, it took me like 15 minutes to get there. How is that possible so near L.A.?) Being an avid animal lover and animal rights supporter my whole life, I was feeling a little strange about attending (and in turn, supporting) an event where little calves are lassoed, thrown to the ground, and bound with thick rope at their feet by big cowboys (and a couple of cowgirls - yee haw!). </p>

<p>Even though they have an <a href="http://www.sandimasrodeo.com/main.php?zone=animalwelfare">animal welfare statement</a> about the humane treatment of professional rodeo animals, I still felt an odd sense of estrangement from the rest of the crowd watching around me as they cheered on the steer wrestling and buckle wearing.</p>

<p>But alas, my ties to my best friend - whose dad is the President of the Rodeo (yes, they have one) - won out. So I sucked it up and enjoyed my V.I.P. pass. </p>

<p>And all wasn't lost. There were rodeo clowns there. </p>

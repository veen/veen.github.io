<h2 class="title">Only 1/3 Geek...(Translating services available on request)</h2>
<h3 class="date">January 30, 2004</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>You are <b><span style="color: #090">33%</span></b> geek</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thudfactor.com/images/geekquiz/girl_25x50.jpg" height="170" width="120"></p>

<p>		You are a geek liaison, which means you go both ways. You can hang out with normal people or you can hang out with geeks which means you often have geeks as friends and/or have a job where you have to mediate between geeks and normal people. This is an important role and one of which you should be proud. In fact, you can make a good deal of money as a translator. </p>

<p><b>Normal:</b> Tell our geek we need him to work this weekend. <br />
<b>You [to Geek]:</b> We need more than that, Scotty. You'll have to stay until you can squeeze more outta them engines!<br />
 <b>Geek [to You]:</b> I'm givin' her all she's got, Captain, but we need more dilithium crystals!<br />
 <b>You [to Normal]:</b> He wants to know if he gets overtime. <br />
 <br />
 Wow. It's something I've <i>always</i> known about myself, but never confirmed. It's official now. I've taken the <a href="http://www.thudfactor.com/geekquiz.php">Polygeek Quiz at Thudfactor.com</a> and all my suspicions have been validated. I am surrounded by geeks - my husband, my brothers, my friends - yet, I have never been able to wholly claim geekdom as my own. But I do, indeed, speak the language well enough that I could translate it at parties. And I'm able to cross geek to non-geek culture with a single bound. </p>

<h2 class="title">Feeling a little bit richer...</h2>
<h3 class="date">January 28, 2004</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>I stumbled across the UK site "Global Rich List" while I was reading another <a href="http://randomthinks.typepad.com/rtblog/">blog</a>. Wow. Talk about an eye opener. If I ever thought I don't make enough money, or my salary just doesn't reflect my worth, I can think about the 5,728,695,652 (yes, that's 5.7 BILLION) people poorer than me in the world. And considering there are currenly just slightly over 6 billion people on the Earth today, that number is staggering. Even with my measly salary, I am in the top 4.52% and considered the 271,304,348 richest person in the world.</p>

<p>It's easy to see for yourself the huge chasm between the richest nation in the world and the majority of poor who live on under $2 a day. Just go to <a href="http://www.globalrichlist.com/">the site</a> and plug in your own numbers. It really is fascinating and puts a whole new perspective on our wealth as Americans. As the makers of the site say: "We are obsessed with wealth. But we gauge how rich we are by looking upwards at those who have more than us. This makes us feel poor." They wanted to help people who saw the site (who, for that very reason, already are a privileged minority) see where they stand globally. And they're doing it not just to show us some amazing facts, but to raise money for a pretty <a href="http://www.careinternational.org.uk/">worthy cause</a>. <br />

<h2 class="title">Far worse than Mad Cow Disease</h2>
<h3 class="date">January 23, 2004</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p><img alt="brains ick.jpg" src="http://www.veen.com/amy/archives/brains ick.jpg" width="410" height="269" border="0" /></p>

<p>Before I even knew what this AP picture was, I believed it to be one of the sickest looking photographs of food I'd ever seen. Now that I know what it is, I will hands-down say it <i>is</i> the sickest food photo I've seen. It's deep-fat-fried cow brains. Yes, cow brains. Deep-fried. And it seems the recipe is in my ancestry. Dutch and German immigrants brought it over with them and passed it on from generation to generation. Aren't we lucky?</p>

<h2 class="title">Blog? What the...?</h2>
<h3 class="date">January 22, 2004</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>Yes, I blog. At times. I'll admit I haven't been the most consistent (or interesting) one to post in my family or of the people I read. And I think a lot of it has to do with what <a href="http://www.joshcagan.com/archives/2004_01_01_index.html#107472489872543536">Josh Cagan</a> said today. I'm sure everyone who blogs has had the embarrassing confrontations with people who have no idea what a weblog is, or who do not understand the significance of self-publishing the thoughts that run around in your head throughout the day. </p>

<p>Just last night, I was talking to a friend about my blog and got that look. You know the one. You're having an interesting conversation and someone touches on a subject you've mentioned in your blog. And you tell them about it, referencing your own writing. And they laugh and say, "Your BLOG?" And you're reminded that you're the only one that actually reads your own blog. Heh. You'll get over it.</p>

<p>Well to all those non-bloggers who have no idea why we do this...</p>

<p>   A. It's actually entertaining to have a place to rant and ramble and not have to see a face of someone I might have offended.<br />
  <br />
   B. If the blogging stopped, I would seriously lose a great portion of my daily news and interesting reading material. There are a <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/">lot</a> <a href="http://www.feministe.us/blog/">of</a> <a href="http://www.veen.com/leslie/">mighty</a> <a href="http://www.overcaffeinated.net/">fascinating</a> <a href="http://randomthinks.typepad.com/rtblog/">people</a> <a href="http://www.veen.com/greg/">out</a> <a href="http://sfgate.com/columnists/morford/">there</a>.<br />
   <br />
   C. As Josh writes it: "Really, I get a fair amount of pleasure from writing this, as it keeps my mind in shape while I don't have an actual writing 'Job'."<br />

<h2 class="title">Home Sweet Home</h2>
<h3 class="date">September 10, 2005</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>We are home! And this is my (Amy's) first post since pre-life with Sophie. I am so thankful to my husband who faithfully kept everyone informed of the happenings during and post labor on the blog. Not only that, even when the poor guy could hardly keep his eyes open, he ran ran off to buy us groceries while I was in the hospital to make sure our house was well stocked when we got here yesterday. It doesn't get better than that - I'm so lucky!</p>

<p>We have now been home for a whole 24 hours and family life is starting to settle in. My mom stayed here last night. This is honestly the only reason I am able to post this blog right now. Sophie was up most of the night, angry because she was quite hungry and mommy wasn't able to give her the amount of food she needed. It's hard to communicate the ins and outs of milk supply to a newborn. Believe me, I tried at 4:00 am, and she wasn't putting up with my silly explanations. But Grandma Arlys, being a nightshift neonatal nurse for 35 years, forced Chris and I back to bed and gladly spent the following hours teaching Sophie about appropriate nighttime behavior. Grandma rocks! So does sleeping!</p>

<p>I also want to reiterate Chris' sentiments from yesterday. We are so blessed to have such truly amazing friends and family in our life. The abundance of calls, emails, visits and just general well wishes has been overwhelming and so extremely appreciated. As I told Sophie yesterday just before we introduced her to the real world outside the hospital walls, "Life is sometimes hard, but you are lucky to have so many people who love you. We know a lot of great people, and that makes all the difference."</p>

<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>First, saw pictures of Sophie, and one word sprung to mind -- schmoopie; of course, I must be having HS flashbacks because I've been saying that a lot lately.  Second, yet another HS flashback; saw your quotes list on MySpace, and all I gotta say is $240.00 can buy you a WHOLE lotta puddin'.  All very odd, since I don't really think about HS really at all at other times.  Anyway, again, adorable baby.  I'm Audi 2000.</p>

<p>And then there were three!!!</p>

<p>We just stumbled across the news and we are SO elated! Sophia is beautiful, but we don't have to tell you that. Congratulations - we can't wait to meet her in person! </p>

<p>Thanks be to God ~ D&T</p>

<p>Soph Loaf!  That's so wrong...but sooooo funny.<br />
We called Silas Sgt. Poopy Pants.  Well...it doesn't need much in the way of explanation.</p>

<p>Fiona poops once or twice every 3-4 days.  She's still mostly breast feeding...so it's mostly normal.  But when she DOES it's scary.</p>

<p>Things to look forward to.  She's just now pushing herself up and really watching and interacting with us (this is 5 months old now).  It's great.</p>

<p>I'm truly excited for you guys...crazy crazy parenting world.  The Land of the Lost.  No time exists.  Only the baby (the Queen?).  :)</p>

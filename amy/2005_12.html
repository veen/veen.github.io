<div class="postbody">
<p>I'm back after an annoying week of being offline. Veen.com got hacked and it put <a href="http://www.veen.com">us all</a> out of commission for most of last week. </p>

<p>Sorry for those who came by and were told: "You are not authorized to view this page." Rejection is hard. Blame my ISP.</p>

<p>Things are also crazy for me because I'm in the middle of wrapping up work for the year before my two week Christmas break. Hurray for working for a school that closes down for the holidays! And to add to it all, Sophia's come down with her first cold. Mmm...the smell of vapor rub fills my house.</p>

<p>I'll post more when I come up for air.</p>

<p>Happy Holidays!</p>

Happy 3-month birthday, Sophia! <br />
<br />
We took Sophia's first "official" pictures this weekend. And man, what an ordeal that proved to be! Yes, you see her smiling here. But that was no small feat. That precious smile in the upper left corner was the result of 2.5 hours of talking to her in sing songy baby talk, jumping up and down like a crazy person, nursing her to get her hands out of her mouth for longer than 2 minutes and cleaning baby puke off her dress and my feet.<br />
<br />
The woman at Sears Portrait Studios was the most patient person I've ever met. Either that or she was bored to tears because there were absolutely no other customers there. The result being that she spent 1/2 the day with me jumping through hoops for my daughter and getting some really cute pictures. <br />
<br />
Here were some of my favorites!

<h2 class="title">Morning Eden</h2>
<h3 class="date">December 03, 2005</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>I never, ever thought I would hear myself say it, but I love the early morning hours these days. I'm sitting here in the dark on a Saturday morning with my coffee and my beautiful baby girl. She's nursing and I can't help but laugh as she coos and moans while attempting to eat. (You know the scene in the movie <em>What About Bob?</em> The one where he's eating the meal that he crashed at his theraptist's vacation home and he's moaning the whole time because it's just so good? That is <em>exactly</em> what Sophia does every time she eats. And she's every bit as funny as Bill Murray!)</p>

<p>She's quiet sometimes, yes, but lately she has had just so much to say in her newfound baby language. And I can't get enough. I keep getting in her face and talking to her to see what she'll have to say this time. She loves to sing along. And she is a big fan of vowels. </p>

<p>"Check it out, mom! Oooo, Aaaaa!"</p>

<p>She just fell asleep in my lap, drunk on breast milk. I love that I can be responsible for so much happiness and peacefulness in her life. And even though it's hard for me to go back to work, this means daddy finally gets a chance to feed her from time to time and experience this same amazing feeling. It's hard to share it, but I'm so grateful that my husband is so enormously involved in her life.</p>

<p>She's waking up now and telling me something important in baby code. I'm going to go enjoy this peaceful morning with my girl. The day will speed up way too soon.</p>

<h2 class="title">9 to 5</h2>
<h3 class="date">December 01, 2005</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>Posting has been a little slow lately, and there is a big reason for that... </p>

<p>The day that has been looming overhead has finally arrived. Yesterday I started back to work. </p>

<p>I've been mentally preparing for this day for the last 6 weeks. The first 6 weeks of my maternity leave I tried to just completely ignore the imminent return. But unfortunately, the way my mind works, I couldn't stop it from creeping into my thoughts during the last 6 weeks.</p>

<p>"Twelve weeks?" you may ask. "How did you pull that one off?" Well, I work for a really cool <a href="http://www.artcenter.edu">art school</a> that allowed me to take the amount of time that I felt I needed. It's no comparison to Europe, where Sweden offers <a href="http://www.mercerhr.com/pressrelease/details.jhtml/dynamic/idContent/1079665">96 weeks of leave</a>! Australia and New Zealand would be my next choice of residence, offering a full year off for new mothers. But three months off for me was definitely great. The most wonderful part about it all is that Chris works from home. So really, it was 12 weeks of whole family bonding time, not just mother/daugther bonding. Chris got to be there for all of it, too. </p>

<p>So there you have it. I'm back to work. I miss my baby terribly, but I know it will be OK in the long run. She gets to actually spend quality time with her grandmas and daddy, which is great for her. And luckily her best hours of the day are the early morning hours, which I get to spend joyfully with her. So now I'll have all kinds of new parenting topics for the blog in the upcoming weeks (you're thrilled, I'm sure), such as how to get work done without checking out my girl on Flickr all day and pumping in style in the depths of Art Center. Seriously, you should see this room they have set up for private pumping (think high school sick room with a cot and pillows with paper cases). </p>

<p>Let the adventure begin.</p>

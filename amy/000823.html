<h2 class="title">9 to 5</h2>
<h3 class="date">December 01, 2005</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>Posting has been a little slow lately, and there is a big reason for that... </p>

<p>The day that has been looming overhead has finally arrived. Yesterday I started back to work. </p>

<p>I've been mentally preparing for this day for the last 6 weeks. The first 6 weeks of my maternity leave I tried to just completely ignore the imminent return. But unfortunately, the way my mind works, I couldn't stop it from creeping into my thoughts during the last 6 weeks.</p>

<p>"Twelve weeks?" you may ask. "How did you pull that one off?" Well, I work for a really cool <a href="http://www.artcenter.edu">art school</a> that allowed me to take the amount of time that I felt I needed. It's no comparison to Europe, where Sweden offers <a href="http://www.mercerhr.com/pressrelease/details.jhtml/dynamic/idContent/1079665">96 weeks of leave</a>! Australia and New Zealand would be my next choice of residence, offering a full year off for new mothers. But three months off for me was definitely great. The most wonderful part about it all is that Chris works from home. So really, it was 12 weeks of whole family bonding time, not just mother/daugther bonding. Chris got to be there for all of it, too. </p>

<p>So there you have it. I'm back to work. I miss my baby terribly, but I know it will be OK in the long run. She gets to actually spend quality time with her grandmas and daddy, which is great for her. And luckily her best hours of the day are the early morning hours, which I get to spend joyfully with her. So now I'll have all kinds of new parenting topics for the blog in the upcoming weeks (you're thrilled, I'm sure), such as how to get work done without checking out my girl on Flickr all day and pumping in style in the depths of Art Center. Seriously, you should see this room they have set up for private pumping (think high school sick room with a cot and pillows with paper cases). </p>

<p>Let the adventure begin.</p>

<p>"Pumping in style" -- that's funny.  Until you've had the pleasure of dropping 300 bones on one of those odd, but strangely fascinating, bad boys, you don't fully understand that the "style" part better count for something.  Oh, who am I to complain, I'm not the one getting hooked up to it -- now, that would be odd.</p>

<p>P.S.  The Jake-meister sends his regards.</p>

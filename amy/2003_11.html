<h2 class="title">As American As…</h2>
<h3 class="date">November 25, 2003</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>I really don't like Hummers. And it's not just because I am opposed to our newly elected governor who drives and promotes these beasts of the road. And it's also not just because they're menacing and bossy. It's because to me they stand for something very, very American and, in turn, very, very scary. </p>

<p>This is why I love Slate's <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2091577/">Seth Stevenson's</a> critique of <a href="http://hummer.com/bigrace/bigrace.html">Hummer's new ad</a>. The one where the kid builds a Hummer-looking soapbox car by stealing wood from a dog house, is mocked by all the other kids because of its unorthodox appearance, and ends up pulling through in the end by "off-roading" (read: cheating) his way to the finish line and getting first place. </p>

<p>Stevenson sums it up correctly: "Of course, some will love the shameless Hummer kid and his take-no-prisoners, win-at-all-costs individualism. Not coincidentally, these are the sort of people who buy Hummers."<br />

<h2 class="title">This gravy has fizzy bubbles...</h2>
<h3 class="date">November 24, 2003</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>In two days, my husband, dog, and I will be heading up to San Francisco to spend another Thanksgiving in the beautiful, nature-loving, freethinking city that I love. Besides drinking plenty of good Peet’s coffee, we will, of course, be dining on an all-organic meal of Mesquite BBQ turkey (Mmm…something about that smoky flavor) and all the fixing. </p>

<p>But I wonder, why is everyone going through all the hassle of a traditional meal when some innovative (read: creepy and bizarre) person created this time-saving <a href="http://www.jonessodastore.com/files/tg-101.html">meal in a bottle</a>? <br />

<h2 class="title">Going Postal</h2>
<h3 class="date">November 19, 2003</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>Isn’t it sort of sad that the United States Post Office has to advertise? Especially around the holidays when everyone is sending mail anyway. I’ve always kind of thought of the post office like I think of, say, electricity. You use it, but not because you saw the ad on TV. You use it because it’s a part of life. You send a letter (well, we used to anyway) because it was the way you communicated with your friend on the east coast or your cousin in Holland. Now we have email and cell phones and cheaper airline tickets – a hundred <a href="http://www.trillian.cc/downloads/">ways</a> to make <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/spotlight-full.shtml">communication</a> easier.</p>

<p>So when I see the <a href="http://www.usps.com/">USPS</a> commercials on TV and their huge promotion for the Cat In The Hat, I have to wonder what the heck is going on. Maybe they just need a new slogan. Wouldn’t you send a letter over an email if they advertised, “Use the United States Postal Service and Go Postal!”<br />

<h2 class="title">Be All That She Can Be...</h2>
<h3 class="date">November 12, 2003</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>Chris asked me last night what my thoughts were about women serving in the military. Probably because Jessica Lynch's story is all over the place these days. Not a subject I think often about, but what I realized is that I have mixed feelings and emotions about it all. </p>

<p>I am a pacifist. I dislike war and all it represents. I believe people who serve our country in the military are brave folks, don’t get me wrong, but I wish there were no need for it. Doesn’t everyone, though? (Actually, I’m pretty certain the current administration would not answer yes to that question.) </p>

<p>What the issue boils down to is that human life is sacred and precious and valuable. And the fact that we think it’s OK to send <i>anyone </i>off to kill or be killed is horrific to me, let alone sending a woman. I am all for women’s rights, women having the same options as men. But should they in this case? Women produce life from within them. They bear children. Men do not. We are all for sending women into the ugliness of war, training them up the in the same way as a man, but the fact is that if they are captured, they will most likely not face the same punishment as a man. In many countries where our military fights, women are seen as inferior to men, at best, and at worst, slaves or property. </p>

<p>For me, what it all boils down to is that I am just anti-war and anti- building up a military that is so big and powerful that so many of our programs and services in this country have been neglected for far too long because there’s no money left for them.<br />

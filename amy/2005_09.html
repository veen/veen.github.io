<h2 class="title">White noise. We honor you.</h2>
<h3 class="date">September 28, 2005</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>Here I sit with "the Loaf" on my belly as I type this post. I mention Sophia in the first line because, well, everything in my life is her right now, so it seemed appropriate. ;)</p>

<p>Topic of discussion for today: The awaking of the newborn. A very interesting stage when, as a new parent, you start to wrongly assume that this beautfiul baby will be asleep for the rest of her life, and that you will merely need to feed her when she occasionally opens her eyes and change her diapers when she smells. I envisioned happily toting my sleeping child off to kindergarten for the first day of school and, eventually, my calmly sleeping teenager off to the prom. Oh no - do not be deceived. They wake up! And when they do, let's hope you are ready!</p>

<p>Chris and I have been trying to figure out the whole nighttime thing. Apparenly our daughter really likes the noise and distraction of the daytime. She likes it so much that it lulls her right to sleep. She loves our voices. She loves "Bridge Over Troubled Waters" playing at high decibels. She even loves the sound of daddy's "Need for Speed" on XBox. Go figure. And then there's the nighttime  that is just so quiet and dark. Not at all a time when a baby should be sleeping, Sophie thinks! </p>

<p>So we checked all baby resourses and found that it's OK to overwhelm the nursery with noise. More specifically, white noise. Last week, after trying unsuccessfully to get her to sleep with the handy little white noise/music maker that conveniently came with our Pack n' Play (it just doesn't go loud enough!), I busted out the hairdryer. </p>

<p>Bam - right to sleep! </p>

<p>But what to do about the high energy bill that would result from running it all night, not to mention the fact that those things burn themselves out pretty quickly? For all you new parents at your wit's end (who also happen to have a computer in your baby's room), here is your solution: Chris downloaded a sample of a hairdryer, opened it up in WaveLAB, made a continuous loop, turned up the buffering in WinAMP, and we let it run. Sophie couldn't be happier!</p>

<p>As Chris says, "That's some cheap baby crack, man."</p>

<h2 class="title">A whole lot of firsts...</h2>
<h3 class="date">September 18, 2005</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>I haven't posted in a while because of an overwhelming number of "firsts" I experienced this past week. Unfortunately last Wednesday, as I was healing from childbirth only a week earlier, I experience some major bleeding and had to be rushed back to the hospital - this time by ambulance (one major first) to the ER (another major first). This was a pretty scary experience, and definitely one I would rather not have to endure again. But as Chris says, "As easy as Amy's delivery was, she has officially earned our little one many times over." No kidding.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us, we have amazing family and friends who jumped in at moment's notice to lend a hand. Grandmas and Aunties were there to take care of Sophia so that Chris was able to get to the hospital not long after me. </p>

<p>My ER experience was horrible, but I had my husband and my mom there for the crucial parts, which  made it more bearable. And then I was rushed to surgery (again, another major first for me) to remove extra particles that were left inside me from my labor and delivery. I recovered in the maternity ward for a couple days and was finally able to come home on Friday night. </p>

<p>Needless to say, I'm exhausted but very thankful to be home with my husband and my little girl. I missed her a lot, considering I had to leave her after only a week of bonding! But it took no time at all for the two of us to pick up where we left off. </p>

<p>Now we're back to figuring out life again and getting me healthy and healed. I've still got a lot of questions about everything that went down, but I'm going to be seeking out answers over the next week with my doctors and trying to make sense of everything.</p>

<p>Please keep our family in your thoughts and prayers if you think of it, as we feel like we're kind of back at the beginning. We definitely appreciate it!</p>

<h2 class="title">The Soph Loaf</h2>
<h3 class="date">September 13, 2005</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>Right now everything is baby in our house. The concept of time or date seems irrelevant. What matters is whether or not it fits in with Sophia's master plan. </p>

<p>For example: <br />
That cookie looks really good. (Later will Sophia like those chocolate chips that mommy ate when she goes to nurse?)</p>

<p>I need to shower. (Will Sophia mind if I stop staring at her for 15 minutes to bathe myself?)</p>

<p>Let's try for four hours of sleep tonight. (Will I miss something important if I shut my eyes for too long?)</p>

<p>All in all though, it's been wonderful! We are loving every minute of this new parenting thing. We love her cheeks. We love her hilarious noises (the squeal is our favorite at the moment) and we love just generally being around her and watching her grow. Right now it's pretty easy because she sleeps for the majority of the day, which is why we've started calling her the Soph Loaf. But I'm sure it will get a little crazier around here soon enough!</p>

<h2 class="title">Home Sweet Home</h2>
<h3 class="date">September 10, 2005</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>We are home! And this is my (Amy's) first post since pre-life with Sophie. I am so thankful to my husband who faithfully kept everyone informed of the happenings during and post labor on the blog. Not only that, even when the poor guy could hardly keep his eyes open, he ran ran off to buy us groceries while I was in the hospital to make sure our house was well stocked when we got here yesterday. It doesn't get better than that - I'm so lucky!</p>

<p>We have now been home for a whole 24 hours and family life is starting to settle in. My mom stayed here last night. This is honestly the only reason I am able to post this blog right now. Sophie was up most of the night, angry because she was quite hungry and mommy wasn't able to give her the amount of food she needed. It's hard to communicate the ins and outs of milk supply to a newborn. Believe me, I tried at 4:00 am, and she wasn't putting up with my silly explanations. But Grandma Arlys, being a nightshift neonatal nurse for 35 years, forced Chris and I back to bed and gladly spent the following hours teaching Sophie about appropriate nighttime behavior. Grandma rocks! So does sleeping!</p>

<p>I also want to reiterate Chris' sentiments from yesterday. We are so blessed to have such truly amazing friends and family in our life. The abundance of calls, emails, visits and just general well wishes has been overwhelming and so extremely appreciated. As I told Sophie yesterday just before we introduced her to the real world outside the hospital walls, "Life is sometimes hard, but you are lucky to have so many people who love you. We know a lot of great people, and that makes all the difference."</p>

<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2 class="title">Almost home...</h2>
<h3 class="date">September 09, 2005</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>We just came back from the Mommy / Baby Camp class and got yet another round of good information.  The great thing about the way they work here at the hospital is that they assume you're not going to absorb anything they're saying to you (which we didn't), so they say it again and again.  It's funny having that ah-ha moment when what they're saying actually clicks and the day-to-day tasks begin to actually make some sense.</p>

<p>Hopefully we'll remember this stuff at 3AM changings and feedings.  :)</p>

<p>Sophia's got one more set of tests, then we eat lunch and then we're out of here!!!  Time to bring our little girl home to her room (and Daddy's office) and see whether or not she likes life with the Fraziers.  Especially Sarah the Dog.  I sure hope Sophie doesn't mind doggie kisses when we let Sarah come see her in a few weeks!</p>

<p>BTW - Thanks to everyone for your encouragement and prayers.  We feel like God has taken care of us through this whole process and that he listens to the prayers of the faithful.  Blessings to all of you!</p>

<h2 class="title">Daddy's Always Laptopin'</h2>
<h3 class="date">September 08, 2005</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>So we're having a great morning!  Amy and I woke up at about 6:00 and enjoyed some moments to ourselves and then began the morning poking and prodding.  Nurse after nurse would come in and help us with pretty much every facet of life after childbirth.</p>

<p>Then came the best part of the day - they brought Sophie in to us and we got to hang out as a family.  As Amy said, "This is what we do as a family... we hang out... Daddy's always laptopin'..."  At which point Amy reminded me that we need to get the Flickr link up on the website so that people can see our little girl.</p>

<p>So here it is...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49503081216@N01/">Amy's Flickr Area</a></p>

<p>Time to go back to fawning over my little girl.</p>

<h2 class="title">Pushing...</h2>

<div class="postbody">
<p>Amy was pushing.  And then the doctor came in and said she was going to do a c-section for another woman, so Amy should stop.  So she's not pushing.</p>

<p>But she WANTS to.</p>

<h2 class="title">Amy (Heart)s Epidurals</h2>

<div class="postbody">
<p>Amy's having a hard time focusing right now (because she's in the middle of labor) so I, Chris, am posting for her.  Yes, we're having our baby and it's going VERY quickly and without complications.  Amy started having contractions at 3:30 this morning and after taking showers and hanging out at the house, we went into the hospital at 5:30.</p>

<p>Once we got in they checked Amy out and she was 90% effaced and 3cm.  They immediately asked if she wanted an epidural, and Amy (being the tough woman she is) said, "We'll see."  After watching her cringe in pain, the nurse asked again and Amy agreed to it.</p>

<p>Thank goodness.</p>

<p>From the point where Amy got the epidural until now (about 2.5 hours later) she's been in great spirits and everything has progressed well.  The contractions are happening much stronger now, so we'll see how long all of this takes.  We'll keep this place posted with news as it happens.</p>

<p>Gotta love open wireless.</p>

<h2 class="title">Updates!</h2>
<h3 class="date">September 06, 2005</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>I have not been the best at keeping my weblog current, but now I have a great reason to. Chris and I are expecting our first baby in just over a week (wow, seriously?). So I have been updated with a brand new front page to the blog, thanks to my fabulously talented husband - a place to send all the wondering friends and family for more information throughout the following days leading up to baby Frazier's introduction to the world. And after that, we will be posting regularly with new photos and updates about life with a newborn. Check in as often as you like to find out what's happening in Frazierland.</p>

<p>I've officially passed Labor Day. It was the big assumption among many that, naturally, I would go into labor then. I guess baby thought that would be too ironic and decided to pass. I can imagine that it's pretty comfortable in there for her and coming out into the heat of late summer isn't the first thing on her mind. But, as even my biggest shirts are slowly being retired one by one, I can't imagine she has much more growing to do (or room in there!) and we're both anxiously waiting to meet her.</p>

<p>We're so excited about this new phase of life. We'll keep you posted...</p>

<p>Now, I'm off to eat some spicey food and go on a long walk. Any other labor inducing remedies are always appreciated!</p>

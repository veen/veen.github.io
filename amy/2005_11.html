<h2 class="title">Sleep rules!</h2>
<h3 class="date">November 19, 2005</h3>

<p>The illustrious day has finally arrived. And much sooner than I thought it would, actually. My wonderful baby is sleeping through the night! We're talking good old-fashinoned, down home 7pm-7am sleep. The first night this happened, earlier this week, I wasn't so sure. I was convinced it was a fluke and if I mentioned it to anyone the lords of fate would jinx me and my sleep-filled nights would disappear. But then it happened the next night. And again. And 4 nights later, I think it's safe to say that my baby likes to sleep. Like <em>really </em>likes to sleep.</p>

<p>And I am forever grateful!</p>

Yesterday, Sophia celebrated two months of life! And what did we get her to mark the special occasion? What every loving mother and father would get their trusting daugther, of course -  two shots in each leg. Ouch!<br />
<br />
Sophia had to endure the horrible reality that her pediatrian is not necessarily her friend. But honestly, she was much more of a trooper than her poor mom. Holding your kid down to inflict pain on them has got to be the worst thing you could do. Ever. Good thing I brought Chris along to be the bad guy.<br />
<br />
I think for her 3 month birthday I'll spring for a pony instead.

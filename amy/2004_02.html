<h2 class="title">Filled with a different kind of passion…</h2>
<h3 class="date">February 25, 2004</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>I saw the film <i>The Passion of The Christ</i> two weeks ago at a huge pre-release viewing for a couple thousand people at Azusa Pacific University, including a pre-show interview with Director Mel Gibson and a lesson from his media guys on how "you, too, can sell this movie to your friends and peer groups," filled with URLs to pass on and phone numbers to call.</p>

<p>I was initially really excited to be there. Excited about my VIP pass. Excited about the hype, to be a part of what I felt was the beginning of "a movement," or, as Mel's camp was promoting, "The biggest outreach opportunity in 2,000 years." </p>

<p>I can say honestly that I was put off before the movie even started. Lee Strobel, a well-known Christian author who was interview Mel Gibson, asked if he felt the movie really deserved it's "R" rating. Mel's reply: "Ooooooooh yes." Why? "It's two hours of watching a man being brutally tortured to death." </p>

<p>And there you have it folks. <i>The Passion of The Christ</i> in its entirety. </p>

<p>There is something to be said about understanding the pain and anguish that Jesus endured. I think it's very important for many people who have lost their way, who have forgotten the sacrifice. But there is so much more to be said of Christ's love and they way he lived life. The movie shows brief moments of humanity when, in flashbacks, you see Jesus as a boy with his mother, Jesus redeeming Mary Magdaline from a life filled with emptyness, Jesus washing the feet of his disciples as a loving act of service. But I wanted more of that. I <i>needed</i> more of that. I wanted a movie about the life of Christ and what he stood for. But I suppose that wouldn't be the Passion. I guess I just wanted a different kind of passion. Passion that leaves me with hope, not with guilt and anger.</p>

<p>One of my favorite columnists, <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2004/02/25/notes022504.DTL">Mark Morford</a> from the SFGate, is not religious, and I don't think he's even seen (or will see) the movie. But maybe he touches on something here that we'd be wise to explore: "You can think you need to have your spiritual belief coated in gallons of blood and death and grisly sacrifice and really bitchin' cinematography, of cruel beatings and nightmarish tortures and gruesome crucifixions…or, you know, you don't. Jesus, rumor has it, didn't die for sin. He died for enlightenment. He didn't die so people would walk around all day in ugly nail necklaces thinking about bloody violent death, swapping quote cards and thinking they know something of the divine. He died to indicate humanity's need to purge itself of hate, war, violence and ego -- you know, all those things now performed in his name."<br />

<h2 class="title">My So-Called Afterlife</h2>
<h3 class="date">February 06, 2004</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>I'm in a pretty amazing book club with a handful of good friends. Because of it, I've had the opportunity to experience some great reads (soon to be listed in a "Current and Recent Reads" section I'm creating for the blog). Recently, we read Alice Sebold's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0316168815/ref=sib_dp_pt/102-4419272-4394542#reader-link">Lovely Bones</a> about 14-year-old Susie Salmon who is raped and murdered in the first chapter by a shady next-door neighbor. Upon reading the first few pages, I wondered how I'd make it through the next 350. Don't worry – it lightens up…a little. Susie then spends the rest of the book narrating the story of her death and the plight of her family's struggle to deal with their loss from her perch up in heaven. </p>

<p>And this is what is interesting. Sebold's secular view of heaven is a therapeutic one, one that reaches out to soothe and explore the inner child, one that allows the deceased to make peace with her life on Earth before fully moving on to the next "stage." </p>

<p><a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2095002/">Slate</a> ran an article today about the 21st-Century American view of heaven, a paradise that is "Disney World, Hawaii, Paris, Rome and New York all rolled up into one"—the "ultimate playground, created purely for our enjoyment." (Excerpts from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/038550988X/102-4419272-4394542">A Travel Guide to Heaven</a>, by Anthony DeStefano.)</p>

<p>Here's what I don't understand. Where is God in either of these views? </p>

<p>I'm as much for travel and great experiences as the next person, but my idea of heaven is neither an X-treme fantasy nor a therapy session where I can put closure on my life. My idea of heaven is one where I am in constant communion with God – one so far beyond this world that I would never be able to compare it to a tourist trip across the country. And I have the feeling that once I'm there, I will not have the smallest desire to concern myself with my past human experience and suffering. As Slate's Adam Kirsch writes, "Instead of angelic choirs, it now seems, we will be greeted in heaven by the sound of a billion voices, all talking about themselves." Postmodernism strikes again. </p>

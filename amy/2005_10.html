<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amyfrazier/57892162/in/photostream/">Smiling</a> has seriously never been so fun! I'd like to re-learn it all over again because of how great Sophia makes it seem.<br />
<br />
If her smiling stage is this adorable, I can't even imagine what we'll do when she learns to laugh.<br />
<br />
I better start preparing now. Bring on the cute!

<h2 class="title">How we scar our children...</h2>
<h3 class="date">October 30, 2005</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>Sophia is a big baby. It's not that she's fat. She's just bigger than many 7-week-olds. And because of that, she has the cutest rolls imaginable. One such roll is located just beneath her chin - her "meat beard", as my dear brother so lovingly called it. And unfortunately for Sophia, we have found that to be quite a catchy phrase.</p>

<p>One thing about infants is that they can't lift their heads for very long. Because of this, the area under Sophia's chin does not get much ventilation (her <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amyfrazier/57891891/">cheeks</a> kind of aid in weighing her head down as well). </p>

<p>Recently, we began noticing a funky smell every once in a while coming from our little girl. We couldn't figure it out. She was bathed. Her diaper was changed. But since she's quickly learning to lift her head on her own for longer periods, we were able to catch a whiff one day as her head was raised and her neck was exposed. </p>

<p>"Whoa! The meat beard needs some attention!" we noticed.</p>

<p>We have now learned to scrub even the most random areas on our baby. She's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amyfrazier/57891947/in/photostream/">squeaky clean</a> these days!</p>

<h2 class="title">Good news is so relative</h2>
<h3 class="date">October 27, 2005</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>So I called up my mom today, totally excited about the fact that Sophie only woke up once during the night for the first time. </p>

<p>"I've got great news!" I tell her, ready to brag about my 7-week-old's 8pm-3am stretch of sleep.</p>

<p>"You're pregnant!?" she screams. </p>

<p>In whose world would <em>that </em>be good news? Anyway, sorry for the letdown, Grandma.</p>

Check out our backyard from Monday afternoon! We had a massive storm come through, dropping tons of rain and hail on our little backyard. It was pretty amazing and our poor yard was totally flooded by the time the whole thing was over. <br />
<br />
Sun's shining now, but man - that was fun while it lasted!<br>

This weekend we did what all new parents do. We dressed up our poor one-month-old daughter in a ridiculous (and cute!) <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amyfrazier/52061765/">costume</a> and showed her off. We actually went to an amazing <a href="http://www.tanakafarms.com/">Pumpkin Patch</a> in Orange County with some friends and their kids (also dressed up, of course). <br />
<br />
Sophie tried out her Halloween costume for a few shots. But nothing would get her to open her eyes - not even the acres and acres of pumpkins surrounding us!<br />
<br />
It was definitely one of those events that you realize is much more for the parents' enjoyment. I'm sure there will be plenty of times in the future when I'll be doing things purely for my daughter's delight, so I figured she could humor me just this once!

As of yesterday, Sophie is officially one month old. It's hard to believe all that has happened in only one month - all that I've gone through physically and all that we've learned as parents (about many previously unknown subjects such as baby butt paste and how to feed an infant with one hand while blogging with the other). It's amazing how much confidence we've gained, too. Admittedly, she was a big baby -- all 9+ pounds of her -- which made her seem much less breakable in the beginning. Perfect for bumbling new parents!<br />
<br />
And look at her now, all bright-eyed and awake to the world! At least for that 15 minute stretch. We couldn't have asked for a better baby. She rarely cries unless hungry or reminding us of our parental diaper duties. She's calm and just genuinely happy. Only moments ago she smiled at me as she was drifting off to sleep, a newly learned skill. So cute. And then her eyes rolled up into her head, as only the baby possessed can. Much less cute, but still endearing.<br />
<br />
Here's to one month, Sophia. And to many, many more!<br />

<h2 class="title">The sound of silence?</h2>
<h3 class="date">October 07, 2005</h3>

<div class="postbody">
<p>Oh silence...I can hardly remember your sweet lack of sound. Aren't you the distant friend whose presence allowed me to sleep till <em>whenever</em> on a Saturday morning? Didn't your being there almost guarantee a good night's sleep just a month ago? </p>

<p>Silence really has no place in my life these days, especially not with a baby monitor merely inches away from my ears during sleeping hours. There's no silence even sitting here at 4:30 in the morning, a wonderful time of night with which I am becoming all too familiar. It's a time that one would normally think should be completely silent.  </p>

<p>But not in my world. Oh no. </p>

<p>Even at this peaceful hour, all around me I hear noise. The <a href="http://www.veen.com/amy/archives/000792.html">white noise</a> blaring from the computer in Sophie's room. Sophie's grunts and moans as she nurses. Even the dog has gotten in on the fun of nightly noisemaking and has taken to scaring me half to death with barking as I creep out of the nursery in the pitch dark. Poor Chris was practically flattened last night as I hurled myself half way across the hallway without touching the ground to safety beneath my comforter! Doesn't my dog know how extremely jumpy lack of sleep can make a person? Do dogs have a sense of humor?</p>

<p>But Sophie's noises are not just limited to nighttime. She is becoming quite a "talker" - grunting through just about every activity of her day. Playing? "Aaarrrhh! Eeerrr!" Sleeping? "aaaaahhh....hrmph....rrrrrmmmm." Staring at herself in her baby mirror? "eeeeeee aaaoooohhh!" And definitely eating. "haaahhhh, uh, uh, haaaahhhh". She sounds like a little dinosoar. A little babydactyl. In fact, that's a little like what she looks like when coming at me - mouth wide, eyes crazed - to feed! She makes these old man guttural grunts as if to say, "Thank you for the sweet nectar of the gods you provide for me, dear mommy." Or maybe it's just gas. </p>

<p>Either way, we're constantly laughing as Sophie continues to be the background narration to our daily activities. Who needs cable anyway?</p>

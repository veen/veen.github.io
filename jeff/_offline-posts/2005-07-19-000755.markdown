My parents have, for the first time, the combination of extended digital cable and a Tivo. This affords them an opportunity to see what this whole Tour de France thing is about. Mom had some questions

<strong>Mom:</strong> What is a "Palaton" in cycling?
<strong>Me:</strong> the peloton is the large group of riders that stays very close in one big mass. It helps them stay out of the headwind.
<strong>Mom:</strong> ok, why don't they just say that
<strong>Me:</strong> who? the commentators?
<strong>Mom:</strong> yes
<strong>Me:</strong> for the same reason football announces don't say, "So-and-so just ran with the ball into the end of the field where the paint is different earning 6 points"
<strong>Me:</strong> they say, "touchdown"
<strong>Mom:</strong> shut up
<strong>Me:</strong> you're watching a French sport!

If you happen to be in San Francisco next week (be it for your <a href="http://www.macworldexpo.com/">annual pilgrimage to Mecca</a> or not), there are a couple of good opportunities to go face-2-face with those like-minded.

First, the snappy kids over at Blogger have organized a lunch-time discussion of, um, you know, that stuff. According to one of the many, many Jasons that work there:

<blockquote>Let's meet at 12:30pm on Tuesday the 11th at the top of the South Hall stairs at Moscone Center. Everyone is welcome (you don't even need a Macworld pass).</blockquote>

More info <a href="http://www.shellen.com/2005/01/macworld-sf-2005-bloggers-lunch.asp">here</a>.

Then, as if that weren't enough, Merlin is having an impeccably organized, type-A happy hour for readers of his 43-Folders blog. He says:

<blockquote>The first-ever 43 Folders Meetup is officially on for MacWorld &rsquo;05 here in San Francisco next week. Windows users welcome, too, of course!</blockquote>

And his info is <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/01/43f_meetup_janu.html">here</a>.

So much to do, and that doesn't even include playing with the new 120-gig-video-iPod-with-Bluetooth-phone. Or whatever.

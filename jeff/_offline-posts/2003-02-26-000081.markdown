My wife, <a href="http://www.veen.com/veen/leslie/">Leslie</a>, is in her second year of study at <a href="http:www.sfts.edu/">San Francisco Theological Seminary</a>. When she entered the program, her goals were open-ended; she didn't quite know what she would do for a career. Over the last 18 months, however, she has realized that she wants to pursue the ministry. She can see herself as a congregations pastor. So can I. Last week, she delivered her first public sermon at Calvary Presbyterian Church here in San Francisco. They've posted it to their <a href="http://calvarypresbyterian.org/sermons/sermon.phtml?SermonID=484">Web site</a>.

If you read Mike's essay on interviewing techniques, you might
find [Karen Holtzblatt's piece][] interesting as well. In it, she makes the case that fewer sessions with users can still be useful -- something we are
asked all the time when proposing research to clients. How can you get
valid results from 10 people, the wonder. Turns out folks aren't all
that different, especially when you focus on the similarities in how
they work, rather than the obvious differences in the population. An
interesting read and good ammunition when proposing low-cost user
research for a Web project.

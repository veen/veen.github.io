My local World-Series-losing baseball team also lost their manager this year. I'd like to offer the <a title="General Manager Jeffrey Veen" href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/images/manager.jpg">perfect candidate</a> for consideration of the open position... Speaking of baseball, on <a href="http://www.peterme.com/">Peter's</a> recommendation  I'm reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0020306652/ref%3Dnosim/hotwiredstyle/">Ball Four</a> by former Yankee/Pilot's pitcher Jim Bouton. In it, he writes a day-by-day diary of what it was like to pitch in the bigs back in 1969. And he talks frankly about the racism, misogyny, and maniacal adherence to "tradition" in that community. It was -- to say the least -- controversial back then, and still makes for a great read.

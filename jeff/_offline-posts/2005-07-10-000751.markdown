Out cycling with my friend Kirby, and he he's on his brand new Colnago. What a gorgeous bike.

<strong>Kirby:</strong> Hey, so, I think I'll sell my old bike -- the Bianchi. You ever use Ebay??

<strong>Me:</strong> Yup, I sold my car to a guy in Hawaii that way.

<strong>Kirby:</strong> Ah, ok. But it's complicated, right? Like, you've got to set everything up first, and I'm not a big techie guy like you.

<strong>Me:</strong> Remind me what it is you do for the Air Force these days?

<strong>Kirby:</strong> Fly giant airplanes around the world, refueling little air airplanes so they don't have to land.

<strong>Me:</strong> Yeah, you'll probably figure out Ebay.

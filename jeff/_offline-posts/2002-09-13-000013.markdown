Wouldn't if be great if you could finally get control of your company's Web efforts? Isn't it frustrating how every department thinks the Web site belongs to them? Peter offers a <a href="http://www.newarchitectmag.com/documents/s=2450/na1002b/index.html">step-by-step guide</a> to getting your organization to do the Right Thing on the Web. This could take years at some companies, other may already be there. In fact, Peter's steps could also be seen as a guide for evaluating just how clued-in a company is.

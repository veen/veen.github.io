"This module adds the 'a' element to the Inline content set of the Text Module, and activates the Hypertext Attribute Collection." I think I may have been away from working drafts for too long -- I'm finding it difficult to interpret that sentence. Regardless, I'm still excited every time I see a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml2/">new spec</a>. Say, is it just me, or is this the first time a W3C acronym has been trademarked?

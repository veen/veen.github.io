The cycling community lost a true friend this week, suddenly and inexplicably. Clay Mankin, owner of the City Cycle bike shop in my neighborhood, was one day into a 300-mile ride down to Santa Barbara when he <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/11/16/BAG1RFOVV81.DTL">collapsed at the side of the road</a>. An autopsy showed that Clay had a heart attack as he was pedaling up Skyline along the ridge of the Santa Cruz Mountains. What a strange juxtaposition to have a life dedicated to enjoyment of cycling end so simply and quietly along one of the most beautiful roads in the world.

Clay was an inspiration to me in how he ran his business. Riding bikes is fun! The better your bike is built, the more fun you'll have! He was known for radiating that energy out through not just our local community, but the bicycle industry. I rode with Clay and the mechanics in his shop many times -- he built the bike I ride today. I'm really going to miss him.

There are more details at the <a href="http://citycycle.com/">City Cycle web site</a>, including information on how to contribute to an education fund set up for Clay's young son, Riley.

On Monday, 11 Feb 2008 (tonight!), I'll be joining <a href="http://subvert.com/blog/front/">Heather Gold</a> at her show in San Francisco. I've been to the show a couple times before, and it's a blast - part standup comedy, part interview, part performance. Imagine the Leno show but people you might actually want to talk to. 

The topic of the show is "My Needs / Your Needs." We'll be discussing what it means to serve someone else, and how you maintain your own identity when you're in a situation like that. This is something that's long been on my mind as a designer - how do I separate what I want from what our users want? Or, more accurately, how do I blend those things together?

Also on the show is my friend <a href="http://www.xigi.net/2007/12/20/april-rinne-goes-to-unitus.html">April Rinne</a>, who specializes in microfinance in the developing world, and author <a href="http://www.theahillman.com/">Thea Hillman</a>, who will be talking about sex parties. How's that for interesting conversation fodder?

Details are <a href="http://crush3r.com/page/kkbgasrsyx">here</a>. Hope to see you there.

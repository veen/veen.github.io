I may not work there day-to-day any longer, but I'm still managing plenty of intellectual collaboration with my friends at Adaptive Path. In fact, they've been kind enough to invite me to speak at the annual <a href="http://adaptivepath.com/events/2006/aug">User Experience Week</a> in Washington DC, 14-17 August 2006. 

The event is really shaping up well, including speakers such as author <a href="http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/">Steven Johnson</a>, <a href="http://www.pentagram.com/en/partners-bierut.htm">Michael Bierut</a> of Pentagram, and the always-entertaining <a href="http://www.uie.com/about/consultants/">Jared Spool</a>. And if you sign up by July 1, you can still get $100 off. Hope to see you there.

My inbox is full of friends asking if that was me yesterday. Indeed, I was interviewed on both KTVU-2 and KGO-7 at the T-Mobile International bike race in San Francisco yesterday. And what a race it was. Eki, Vino, Gartzelli, Simone, and -- of course -- Armstrong, climbing hills two blocks from my house. I'm working on getting some video online, but for now, check out <a href="http://pictures.sprintpcs.com/shareImage/2929494658_468.jpg?border=2,255,255,255,1,0,0,0,0&amp;invite=iEyr2HY6mmzCi5G7LhFU">this image</a> I snapped with my phone. Are there other sports where you can be this close to your heros?

Here are the things I rode past, around, or over during the last few days:

<ul><li>Numerous upended trees. Some enormous.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/object/article?o=0&f=/c/a/2006/01/02/MNGV3GG73O1.DTL">A landslide</a>.</li>
<li>A dead fish. In the middle of the road.</li>
<li>A dead snake. Same road.</li>
<li>A live crab. A bit further on.</li>
<li>Water so deep on the bike path that it covered my bottom bracket.</li>
<li>Two teenagers hiding behind the north tower of the Golden Gate Bridge getting _very close to third base.</li></ul>

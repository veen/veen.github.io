Mann III gets some good ink in the New York Times on how <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/12/weekinreview/12HARM.html?pagewanted=print&amp;position=">camera phones are changing our notion of privacy</a>. Well, except for the fact that he never really said that. Be sure to read <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/previously/002747.php">Merlin's side of the story</a>, too.

My good friend Lance Arthur <a href="http://www.lancearthur.com/archives/000025.html">deconstructs cycling in the city</a>, and ends up outing me in the process:

<blockquote>Bikers are the fags of automotive society...  Stage One are those who wear the skin-tight nylon outfits. Garish colors and wacky glasses and clip-on shoes. Very stylish, very circuit boy, very 'look-at-me!' Out and proud bikers you couldn't mistake for straight drivers if you tried.</blockquote>

After you finish this, click back and read <a href="http://lancearthur.com/">everything Lance has written</a>. It's wonderful -- as if David Sedaris had a Web log.

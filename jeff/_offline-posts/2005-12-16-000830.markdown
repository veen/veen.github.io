Hackerz! Script vulnerabilities! Other terrible things that happen to your domain only while you're traveling...

So yeah, veen.com was down for most of the week, reeling from some very bad things that happened in our account. I found this out while waiting for a flight to Boston, just as the agent made the boarding call. That right there pretty much defines the feeling of helplessness.

Our ISP grudgingly turned us back on today, though not without a stern warning about keeping our web-based scripts at their latest versions. Email is slowly catching up, but if those of you who wrote and haven't heard back may want to send another note.

Happy holidays!

This morning, I stood before San Francisco Deputy County Clerk Maribel Jaldon, raised my right hand, and swore the following:

<cite>I, Jeffrey Veen, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California, that I take this obligation freely, without mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I am about to enter.</cite>

Now, as a Deputy Marriage Commissioner, I will have the pleasure of binding in to matrimony my two <a href="http://www.mightygirl.net/">best</a> <a href="http://www.b-may.com/">friends</a> next week Saturday.

Next up, I will use my new position to repeal the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html">Second Amendment</a>, extend <a href="http://www.uhcan.org/">universal health care</a> to all, and redirect this country's military budget to public schools. I am giddy with power.

Recently I had the opportunity to sit down with <a href="http://josh.the-owens.com/">Josh Owens</a> and <a href="http://www.justhack.com/">Chris Sayler</a> of the <a href="http://www.web20show.com/">Web 2.0 Show</a>. We discussed some of the design and development strategies that went into Measure Map, how Adaptive Path approaches products, and where <a href="http://www.monstro.com/">Lane</a> buys his shoes. 

They released the podcast under a Creative Commons Share-Alike license, so I edited down just my interview and am <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/web20show-JeffVeen-ep17-edit.mp3">hosting it here</a>. The entire show can be downloaded via the link at the bottom of <a href="http://www.web20show.com/articles/2006/04/26/web-2-0-show-episode-17-jeff-veen">this page</a>.

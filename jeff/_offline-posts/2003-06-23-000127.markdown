Two weeks with no email, mobile phone, newspapers, or television. And it was surprisingly easy. After our <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/events/workshops/">workshop</a> in Milan, we drove to the hills of Tuscany, where we had rented a <a href="http://www.perlatoscana.com/pozzarello_uk.html">farmhouse</a> next to <a href="http://www.perlatoscana.com/farmholidays_at_castello_di_grotti.html">this castle</a>. I'm still a bit too jetlagged to write about it all, so read what <a href="http://veen.com/veen/leslie/">Leslie</a>, <a href="http://mightygirl.net/">Maggie</a>, and <a href="http://www.b-may.com/2003_06_01_archive.html#200431811">Bryan</a> had to say.

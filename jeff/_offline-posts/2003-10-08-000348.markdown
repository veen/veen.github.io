First, the <a href="http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/ps/y2003/wrapup.jsp?ymd=20031004&amp;content_id=561485&amp;vkey=ps2003wrapup&amp;fext=.jsp">Giants</a> lose.

Then, the <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/ps/y2003/wrapup.jsp?ymd=20031006&amp;content_id=566564&amp;vkey=ps2003wrapup&amp;fext=.jsp">Athletics</a>.

Now, the <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/a/2003/10/08/national0317EDT0488.DTL">governor</a>.

What next for my beleaguered state?

(Interestingly, I've always perceived a significant cultural split between Northern and Southern California -- ever since I was a kid growing up in Los Angeles. But in reality, it appears that the split is much more prevalent between the coast and the Central Valley. <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/election/races/2003/10/07/map.shtml ">This map</a> tells the story. At least I can feel some amount of pride in my city. San Francisco voted <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/election/races/2003/10/07/CA/San_Francisco/G2003100739.shtml">80 percent</a> against the recall.)

Isn't it nice to get reacquainted with an old friend?

This morning, the fine folks over at Wired relaunched [Webmonkey][]. Somehow, they managed to pry it out of the dying hands of Lycos and revive it as a collaborative site based on MediaWiki. I couldn't be happier to see the site come back; I've just spent a nostalgic afternoon digging through everything that's there.

The original site was founded at HotWired back in 1996 by my friend [June Cohen][]. She pulled a small team together and started publishing tutorials, news, and opinions about how to make the web. They asked me to write a column, which I did for a couple years, and eventually I joined them to redesign the site. I loved that project - it was one of the first sites we built that was dynamically driven through templates rather than as static HTML files - a real separation of content and presentation. It was a big deal for us back then, and it influenced a lot of my future work. 

The new site is equally dynamic, but in a much more contemporary way. As a collaborative wiki, it embraces openness in a way that really resonates with the original mission of Webmonkey. The team wrote about it in the new site's [introduction][]:

>When Webmonkey debuted in 1996, the site was sort of a soapbox for HotWired's engineers and designers -- a place for them to evangelize emerging web standards, rate the newest browsers and demonstrate their bleeding-edge code hacks. Those engineers also produced stacks and stacks of tutorials on all aspects of building for the web. [...] 

>Faced with the prospect of going back into the archives to continuously update and rewrite the older articles, we decided to turn Webmonkey into a collaborative project. It was an easy decision.

I completely agree. And I'm thankful that we have another chapter to follow what really [looked like the end][].

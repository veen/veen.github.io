<a href="http://www.cindyli.com/">Cindi Li</a> and <a href="http://superfluousbanter.org/">Dan Rubin</a> went far too long without sleep. They created <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cindyli/sets/72157594466343737/">Mii characters of web designers</a>. They had them fight in Wii boxing. They made videos and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qX8bPKJEnU">posted them</a> on YouTube. I want to hang out with Cindi and Dan.

_(BTW, <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/">Zeldman</a>, watch your back. I've been training.)

I've watched the low carb craze mostly from afar. Could be that I'm a regular (some say obsessive) cyclist and regularly include mountains of carbohydrates in my diet. Certainly the regime has benefitted many, including some great friends of mine. The radical change in diet certainly spurs immediate change in body image, and frequently a change towards a healthy way of living.

But honestly, the marketing frenzy around the low carb craze has gone from clever to annoying to absurd. Want an example? Chef's Catalog, purveyor of crap nobody needs, is offering a very special product for the Atkins crowd: the <a href="http://www.chefscatalog.com/store/catalog/prod.jhtml?cmCat=search&amp;itemId=cprod7300026">J.A.Henckels Professional "S" Low-Carb Cutlery Set</a>.

I have no further comment.

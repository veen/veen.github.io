I'm spending the week with my partners in our nation's capitol for the second leg of our <a href="http://adaptivepath.com/events/">2002 User Experience Tour</a>. We've had a great time meeting folks and talking shop. If you'd like a look at the materials we've been using, head on over to our <a href="http://adaptivepath.com/workshops/tour2002/">workshop page</a>.

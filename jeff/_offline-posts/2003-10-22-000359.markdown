I'm spending the week in New York City while working on a research project, spending days in Midtown and evenings in the Village. That makes for a lot of trips along the island, and I'm getting better and better at combining cabs and the subway system here. There are a wealth of maps on the Web, the best being directly from the <a href="http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/nyct/maps/submap.htm">NY-MTA</a>. But while looking, I also found a number of interesting "fan" maps for the transit system. Browse around the <a href="http://www.nycsubway.org/maps/historical/">history page</a>, maps of the <a href="http://www.nycsubway.org/maps/track/">actual tracks</a>, and even <a href="http://www.nycsubway.org/maps/fantasy/">fantasy systems</a> -- how some people _wish the system was designed.

My favorites:

Seven very creative and opinionated partners. Three years of startup stress, immense client projects, and constant growth. Sometimes I can't believe we keep it all together at Adaptive Path as tightly as we do. Nor can I believe it was way back in '01 that we first got together in my living room to see if we could make this go.

We've had a number of milestones, for sure, but this one seems more significant: <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/team/news/2004_03.php#000314">Mike has decided to leave</a>. He's long talked about the more esoteric and (frankly) interesting aspects of the intersection of technology and design. And now he's really going to give it his full attention. 

Mike and I first started working together back in the early days of HotWired. I can't wait to see what he does next.

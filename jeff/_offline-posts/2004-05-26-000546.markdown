I was in Hollywood today to meet up with a client. Giving myself plenty of time, I arrived a half hour early and kept driving to seek out coffee. Starbucks is easy enough, but I like the little local cafes. And sure enough, a few blocks into funky <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Lake,_Los_Angeles,_California">Silver Lake</a> I found what I was looking for - the quintessential neighborhood coffee joint. But as I slowed to park, I saw it was closed. Even the sidewalk was roped off. A cop waved at me to keep moving. They were shooting a scene for a movie.</p>

<p>My trip to Los Angeles is complete.

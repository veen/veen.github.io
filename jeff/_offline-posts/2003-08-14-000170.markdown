Eat a garbage burger at the <a href="http://www.digitalcity.com/grandrapids/bars/venue.adp?vid=19542&amp;squery=%2836%3acityids%20AND%203%3avenuetypekey%20AND%20venue%3atype%29%20AND%20108%3afirstletter&amp;uquery=type%3dvenue%26letter%3dL&amp;skip=4">Last Chance Saloon</a>. Shoot blue-collar pool.

Visit the <a href="http://www.ford.utexas.edu/museum/aboutmus.htm">Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum</a>. Look at the long list of names in his Administration. Be amazed at how many of those names hold positions in the current Administration.

Visit <a href="http://www.digitalcity.com/grandrapids/dining/venue.adp?vid=170338">Yesterdogs</a> in East Town at 2am after drinking in the bars of that neighborhood. Order three UltraDogs. Find nirvana.

Enjoy the astonishing talent of Conner Luymes as he plays "Oh When The Saints Go Marching In" with his armpit.

My business partner Lane was married to Courtney last October in a wonderful, multi-tradition ceremony. It was urban and Jewish and Christian and held in a SOMA gallery late on a Saturday night -- so different from our Midwestern event a decade ago. It certainly made me reflect, as all weddings do, on the <A href="http://veen.com/10years/">years Leslie and I have spent together</a>. Anyway, Lane <a href="http://fray.com/drugs/love/lane.html">transcribed his recollections</a> in a piece for The Fray, a site lovingly maintained by another friend of mine, Derek.

I'm walking into <a href="http://www.sonic.net/~wwpints/zeitgeist/">Zeitgeist</a> to meet friends when a big guy in a leather jacket stops me.

"Need to see some ID, yo."

I reach for my wallet; he looks up and starts laughing.

"Oh, heh, never mind. You can go on in."

I squint at him. "Gosh, thanks. Also, you're kind of a jerk."

"Yeah, whatever," he replies. "Have a nice time, grampa."

Seriously, I'm only 35. 

Oh.

Jesse may be my partner now, but I've respected his work since the first time his <a href="http://jjg.net/ia/elements.pdf">user experience chart</a> (<img src="/images/icons/documents/small/pdf.gif" alt="PDF Icon" /> 17k) flashed across my screen. He's taken that nugget of an idea and worked it into a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735712026/qid=1031859660/hotwiredstyle">fully fleshed-out book</a>, and I suggest you keep your eyes open for it next month.

Descending a rather steep hill on my bike in the Presidio, I heard a strange sort of scraping noise coming up behind me. I looked over my shoulder to find a kid maybe 15 years old on a skateboard. He pulled up next to me, smiled, then tucked down into a crouch and sped ahead. I looked down at my computer.

32mph.

Janice takes <a href="http://www.newarchitectmag.com/documents/s=2450/na0802b/index.html">a good, hard look</a> at what it costs to conduct usability tests. And not surprisingly, it's a whole heck of a lot cheaper to do it yourself rather than hire fancy, expensive consultants. I agree, even if I am one of those consultants. I'd rather teach my clients to integrate usability into every single thing they do, as opposed to scheduling with me when they manage to plan far enough ahead. Live and breath research, folks.

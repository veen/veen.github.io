Yeah, I know. I'm a little tired of that question, too. But the good folks over at Digital Web Magazine asked Jesse James Garrett and me for our thoughts on the subject, and the resulting <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/interviews/interview_2002-08.shtml">interview</a> came out quite nicely. I'm particularly interested in how IA can move away from being a "discipline" and more a set of skills <i>every</i> Web designer should master.

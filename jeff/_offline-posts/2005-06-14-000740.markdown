About 30 minutes into a recent cross-country flight, a harried flight attendant gets on the PA and announces: 

<blockquote>Ladies and gentlemen, I regret to announce that on tonight's flight we will be serving you with just three flight attendants rather than the normal crew of six. We ask for your patience, and we assure you that we will do the best we can.

Also, we have run out of tomato juice.

And ... napkins.</blockquote>

I understand logistics are really complicated in the airline industry, but wow - napkins, too?

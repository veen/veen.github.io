I had really hoped to do the AIDS LifeCycle ride this year. It's an astonishingly good cause, and would have been a great way to put a few hundred miles into my legs all at once while meeting other like-minded folks. But red tape, schedule, and a variety of other reasons (excuses?) all conspired against me, and I just couldn't do it. However, that doesn't mean we all can't help out a little. A pastor that I know from a San Francisco Presbyterian Church will be peddling down to Los Angeles next month, and I think we should all throw a few bucks his way. His name is John Anderson, and you can sponsor him <a href="https://www.aidslifecycle.org/donate/form.cfm?n=1757">here</a>. It will only take you a couple minutes, and you can use your credit card. So go. Seriously. Right now. GO!

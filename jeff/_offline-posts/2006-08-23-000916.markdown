Speaking of <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000915.html">interesting events</a>, my colleague Peter is helping to organize <a href="http://ideaconference.org/">Idea 2006</a> at the amazing Seattle Public Library on October 23-24. He sounds pretty excited about it:

<blockquote>I know of no other conference like this one -- bringing together design practitioners from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds who are addressing the common challenge of designing in an increasing complex information world. This definitely won't be the same old thing.</blockquote>

The <a href="http://ideaconference.org/program.html">list of speakers</a> certainly looks intriguing; only a handful of them actually make their living on the Web, yet nearly all spend their time thinking about the experiences people have with products or services.

I'm trying Technorati's new "Link Count Widget" on my blog -- it's a bit of Javascript that adds the number of other sites linking to each post. It's a nice way if reinforcing the notion that blog posts don't exist in isolation, but are often part of a larger conversation.

Tantek describes the feature in more detail <a href="http://technorati.com/weblog/2006/11/209.html">here</a> and you can get the code <a href="http://technorati.com/tools/linkcount/">here</a>.

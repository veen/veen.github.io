Blog tool developers [Six Apart][] launched a new site last night designed by [Mule Design][]. It's a great example of a simple, consistent corporate site -- especially considering the complexity and wealth of content to be found there. In particular, have a look at:

- Simple architecture.
- Clean, consistent visual design.
- XHTML Transitional code that [validates][].
- Flash text-replacement using [sifr][].
- Technological eating of one's own [dogfood][].

Nice work, everyone.

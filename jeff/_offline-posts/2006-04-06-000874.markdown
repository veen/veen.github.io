Despite our many responsibilities at Google, the Measure Map team has managed to find a new obsession: the perfect espresso. <a href="http://www.fivesevensix.com/">Ryan</a> in particular has gone right over the top in his quest; having given up on drinking from paper cups, a porcelain espresso serving set showed up on his desk last week.

Searching for guidance, we contacted our friend Cory for help. Cory is responsible for training baristas at a highly regarded local chain of caf&eacute;s (and not the ones with green aprons, thank you very much). We have been implementing his suggestions, tweaking variables we can control, and perfecting our technique. Here's what he had to say.

<blockquote>
You have no idea how much has been written and discussed about this very subject, but I have some numbers for you off the top of my head.

There is often an indented line about a quarter inch from the lip of the basket (on the inside). The coffee should reach up to this line AFTER it has been tamped. <br clear="all" />

They have barista competitions where they press a tamper on a scale to see how accurately they can press. Personally I think that rule is kind of silly. A good firm tamp (no need to put your full weight into it) should be fine.<br clear="all" />

There should be a delay of approximately 4 seconds between the button being pressed and coffee coming out of the spout. During those 4 seconds the grounds are absorbing the water. <br clear="all" />

the consistency of poured oil. The final yield should be about 1 to 1.25
oz. (a shot glass works well to check).<br clear="all" />

With Cory's help, we're getting better. Maybe we'll send Ryan to the <a href="http://www.worldbaristachampionship.com/default.htm">competition in Berne this year</a>.

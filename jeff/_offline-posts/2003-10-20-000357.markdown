Lou Rosenfeld and Steve Krug in town for their <a href="http://www.louisrosenfeld.com/presentations/seminars/eia/">workshop series</a>, and Adaptive Path thought that would be the perfect excuse to have a beer. So if you're in San Francisco tonight and want to talk shop, and get to know Lou, Steve, and their seminar attendees, come on by. "Final Final" is just a few blocks from the seminar location, The Palace of Fine Arts. We'll be getting started around 5:30 p.m. The bar is "<a href="http://sanfrancisco.citysearch.com/profile/911235/">FINAL FINAL</a>," 2990 Baker Street (at Lombard Street).

Unfortunately, I won't be there (I'm in Manhattan this week), but <a href="http://adaptivepath.com/team/jjg.php">Jesse James</a> will be on site handing out drink tickets.

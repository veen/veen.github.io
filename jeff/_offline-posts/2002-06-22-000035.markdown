Marc spoke at Adaptive Path's workshop in Chicago, delivering a wonderful full day tutorial on how  to actually do something with the data you get from user research. Before we left for Chicago, [I interviewed him][1] via email on what he thought about collaboration, research, and his teaching engagement at Carnegie Melon University.

<a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/">Merlin D. Mann III</a> on successful project management, in free verse:

I remember telling a friend
that being a project manager
is a little like being a bouncer:
where there's a problem *here*
and a door *there*
and it's your job to get the problem out the door.
So
For some a gentle gesture will do
while others need a push
and still others need to be picked up by their pants and carried
But!
In no case should you ever let someone get *further* from the door.
So that's me.

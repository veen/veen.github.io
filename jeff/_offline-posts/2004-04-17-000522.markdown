Driving the Turquoise Trail from Santa Fe to Albuquerque, I stopped in <a href="http://www.turquoisetrail.org/madrid.htm">Madrid</a> (pronounced <s>MAY-dreed</s> MAH-drid) for coffee at the Red Door Cafe. As I walked in, a young woman behind the counter was addressing a group of old-timers sitting around with their newspapers and cigarettes.

<strong>Young Woman:</strong> You're kidding, right? You don't actually mean that, do you?

<strong>Old-timer:</strong> I'm dead serious. I think he's great.

<strong>YW:</strong> Seriously? You think George W. Bush is great.

<strong>OT:</strong> Absolutely. I mean, just look at the guy. He's got great hair.

<strong>YW:</strong> What?!? Who cares about his hair?

<strong>OT:</strong> I tell ya, if I still had hair, that's how I'd want it done. That man has got a great head of... OF COURSE I DON'T LIKE HIM!!!

<strong>YW:</strong> I knew it. You can't put nothing by on me.

I am growing a full beard for the first time in my life. It is in response to some developers I'm working with on the <a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/archives/2005/04/my_batteries_ar.html">secret project</a> and their desire to meet their milestones. "I'm not shaving until we launch!" -- a physical manifestation of the stress, energy, and excitement of an undertaking like this.

I, however, am quitting this game. We'll meet our deadlines, hit our goals, and be a good close-knit team. But I will do so clean-shaven. This is why:

<ol>
<li>Physiology and aesthetics occasionally do not partner. That is, I now understand why there is an enormous industry devoted to encouraging hair to grow in some places and not in others. I cannot physically grow a proper beard.</li>
<li>I am a cyclist and when I ride I get sweaty and with a beard... ew. Also, cyclist make a habit of shaving all sorts of things; beards certainly are not part of the sport.</li>
<li>It itches.</li>
<li>People keep asking, "Hey, are you growing a beard?" and it's been over a month. </li>
<li>I could easily be on the cover of _Modern Hobo Magazine.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Update:</strong> Michael <a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/archives/2005/05/mustache_still.html">points out</a> that I'm neither a caveman nor porn star. He makes a strong case for both.

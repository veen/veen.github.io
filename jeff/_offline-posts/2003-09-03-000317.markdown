Tonight, while getting some work done in a hotel, the "High Speed Broadband Immersive Connection to the Future of Productivity!!!" stopped working. I called down to the front desk and asked what was up with the net connection. They didn't know, but had an 800 number that might. I dialed.

<cite>Some guy:</cite> Hello?
<cite>Me:</cite> Um.
<cite>Some guy:</cite> Hello? This is Jim. Who is this?
<cite>Me:</cite> Um. So, I'm calling from a hotel and was told you might be able to help me with the connection to the Web?
<cite>Jim:</cite> What hotel?
<cite>Me:</cite> The Hudson.
<cite>Jim:</cite> Hold on, lemme kick the router.
<cite>Me:</cite> ...
<cite>Jim:</cite> How's that.
<cite>Me:</cite> *click* Yup. Works now.
<cite>Jim:</cite> Yeah, that's what I thought. Why we don't just buy some new Cisco boxes is beyond me. Anything else?
<cite>Me:</cite> Um. No. Thanks Jim. Bye.

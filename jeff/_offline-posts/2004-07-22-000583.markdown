Talking cycling with my friend from Portugal.

<strong>Portuguese Friend:</strong> so, what exactly is the team's role?
<strong>JV:</strong> protect and help the captain and give your guy every possible advantage
<strong>PF:</strong> can they block other riders from passing?
<strong>JV:</strong> no, they block the wind
<strong>PF:</strong> ahhh
<strong>JV:</strong> it saves up to 40% of lance's effort, even up hill
<strong>PF:</strong> so it's not like rollerderby
<strong>JV:</strong> there is a little of that.
<strong>JV:</strong> like actively not blocking the wind for other guys or pulling guys away from the peloton and leaving them stranded.
<strong>PF:</strong> so the <a href="http://www.usps-berryfloor.com/staff.aspx?lang=en&co=us&ID=43">portuguese guy</a> is a windblocker?
<strong>JV:</strong> yes
<strong>JV:</strong> he's also an astonishingly good climber. and responsible <a href="http://www.bike.com/template.asp?date=7%2F11%2F2004+8%3A06%3A50+PM&lsectionnumber=11&display=True">horse owner</a>.
<strong>PF:</strong> we are very proud of him back home.
<strong>PF:</strong> but we will probably eat the horse anyway.

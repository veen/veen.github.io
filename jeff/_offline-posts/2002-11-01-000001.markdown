My multi-talented wife Leslie finished in near record time (well, personal record) last weekend at the Silicon Valley Marathon in San Jose. Since she runs two of these grueling races a year, I'm getting used to reading her as she comes down the last few hundred yards to the finish. This time, she look strong -- really strong. <a href="http://veen.com/jeff/leslie_svmarathon.jpg">See for yourself</a>.

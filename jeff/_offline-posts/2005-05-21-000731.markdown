title: "The President comes to my alma mater"

I graduated from <a href="http://www.calvin.edu/">Calvin College</a> in Grand Rapids, MI. It's a small, liberal arts school operated by the <a href="http://www.crcna.org/">church my parents belonged to</a> back then. It's a safe bet that you haven't heard of it, unless you're _really into Division III basketball. We had a good team.

Anyway, you can imagine my surprise when I found out earlier this month that President Bush would be speaking my little alma mater's commencement ceremony this year. I was immediately conflicted. "The President of the United States will be at Calvin! Wow! ...and... ew!" I mean, leader of the free world and all that -- it's a huge deal. But I haven't hesitated in <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000645.html">making feelings known</a> about this administration.

I wasn't alone. Mr. Bush was at Calvin today, and was greeted by a full-page add in the local paper placed by a large group of faculty, students, and alumni. It included the following:

<blockquote>
As Christians, we are called to be peacemakers and to initiate war only as a last resort. We believe your administration has launched an unjust and unjustified war in Iraq.</blockquote>

and then:

<blockquote>In our view, the policies and actions of your administration, both domestically and internationally over the past four years, violate many deeply held principles of Calvin College
</blockquote>

Three dozen protesters picketed outside the venue, and students wore buttons and armbands saying, &ldquo;God is not a Republican or Democrat.&rdquo;

Most of the media outlets led with the controversy -- and it's not surprising. Karl Rove had approached Calvin with the offer to bring the President, showing a strategic need to bolster support in a state they barely lost to John Kerry in the last election. This would be a perfect opportunity for a warm reception from an evangelical Christian college just before the mid-term elections. But it didn't quite play out that well. And that's big news.

There is coverage in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/22/politics/22bush.html">New York Times</a>, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/05/21/bush.commencement/">CNN</a>, <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/7935229/">MSNBC</a> -- but the best report is in <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/120/53.0.html">Christianity Today</a>.

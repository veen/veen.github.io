I take a spin class at my gym from time to time. As a cyclist, the sessions are a good way to get some structured heart rate training as well as some pedal stroke technique on the fixed gear bikes. And when the weather is really sour, it's sometimes the only saddle time I can get.

The problem, though, is that the classes can really be hit or miss. Well, not so much the classes as the instructors. And really not so much them as their music. Oh, the music can be so bad some times. Today, for example, we were taken on a tour of some of the most painfully bad hits of the last 20 years (seriously, John Cougar _and Bryan Adams? Back to back?) as well as much contemporary awfulness. 

Then, during some teen pop sensation, the music quickly faded down and a large gong sounded and then right back to the song. We all looked up from our bikes, shrugged, and kept spinning. Then, 20 seconds later, it happened again. This time, there was laughter and the instructor sat up with a puzzled look on his face. When it happened a third time, he shook his head, reached over, and hit skip.

"Jeez, that's the last time I bring downloaded music to class without listening to it first..."

Ah, exposed as a criminal by <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,57112,00.html">spoofing</a>. Maybe public humiliation will end up being more effective that ridiculous lawsuits...

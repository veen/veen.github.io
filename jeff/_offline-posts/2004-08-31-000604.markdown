I'm heading of to a particularly <a href="http://www.muledesign.com/erika/extreme_usability.html">interesting workshop series</a>, though Merlin will have <a href="http://www.5ives.com/archives/002984.php">nothing to do with it</a>, and Mike is <a href="http://flickr.com/photo.gne?id=289434">bemoaning the effects</a>. Looks to be a lot of fun, though I am -- for now -- reserving judgment. Wish me luck.

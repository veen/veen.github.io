It's a tough call. Which mark more spectacularly fails at combining the thrill and pageantry of athletic competition with the nuanced craft of graphic design? Cast your vote in the comments. Other submissions heartily encouraged.

For background, see this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/07/world/europe/07olympics.html?ref=world">New York Times article</a> on the reaction to the recently-released London Olympics logo. In particular, London Mayor Ken Livingstone responded to reports of the animated version causing seizures: "If you employ someone to design a car and it kills you, you&rsquo;re pretty unhappy about that. If you employ someone to design a logo for you and they haven&rsquo;t done a basic health check, you have to ask what they do for their money."

My personal _favorite in this category would be the <a href="http://www.sportslogos.net/logo.php?id=2949">1959 Major League Baseball All Star Game logo</a>.

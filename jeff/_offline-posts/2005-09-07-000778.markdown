My little sister Amy is bringing her first baby into a very modern world. Her husband Chris (chatting above) is <a href="http://www.veen.com/amy/">posting from the delivery room</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49503081216@N01/41207605/">uploading to Flickr</a> -- when he's not otherwise preoccupied.

Very exciting!

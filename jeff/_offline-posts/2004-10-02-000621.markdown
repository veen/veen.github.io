Peter Hughes plays bass for the <a href="http://www.themountaingoats.net/">Mountain Goats</a>, loves baseball, and grew up not far from where I did in Chino.

I met him backstage after a show at the Bottom of the Hill a while back, and we talked about our competing high schools, <a href="http://www.westcoastroads.com/california/ca-071.html">Highway 71</a>, and a the general state of things back in the faceless suburbs. He wrote down a <a href="http://www.fivetools.com/">URL</a> for me that night, but the site only had a few photo albums up. I visited today, and found a bunch of stuff, including a <a href="http://www.fivetools.com/pph/index.html">whole album to download</a>. He includes this note:

<blockquote>Listen to these songs. Download &rsquo;em. P2P &rsquo;em. Burn &rsquo;em to a CD and play &rsquo;em really loud in your car with the windows down. And if you get tired of listening to crappy 128kbps mp3s, I&rsquo;ll send you a CD-R for eight bucks postpaid.</blockquote>

Now that's my kind of rock star. Go get 'em, Peter.

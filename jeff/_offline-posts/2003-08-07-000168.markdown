I am certainly not so interested in fashion. In fact, my attitudes on clothing and Web design track pretty consistently: simplicity, quality, ergonomics. And living in an urban center affords me the benefit of simply buying everything in black and knowing I'll be fine.

That said, even I can tell that this whole "some parts of my jeans are worn out more than other parts" trend has gone way too far. Especially when it migrates to jackets. Would someone explain to me exactly what caused <a href="http://www.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=99882&amp;CategoryID=103&amp;LinkType=EverGreen ">this guy's coat</a> to fade this way?

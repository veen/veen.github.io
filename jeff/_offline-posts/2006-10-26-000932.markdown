Congratulations are in order today for two groups of friends: Six Apart <a href="http://team.vox.com/library/post/happy-vox-launch-day.html">opens up Vox</a> and Ev Williams <a href="http://evhead.com/2006/10/birth-of-obvious-corp_25.asp">announces Obvious</a>. 

I'm so happy to see that insanely smart people are still passionate about creating powerful tools. Or, as Om Malik <a href="http://gigaom.com/2006/10/25/odeo-rip-hello-obvious-corp/">put it</a>, "In the end Williams put his money where his heart was." I know the folks behind Vox feel the same. 

Nice going, everyone.

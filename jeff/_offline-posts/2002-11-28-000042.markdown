My wife, Leslie, posts weekly to a <a href="http://veen.com/leslie/">much more interesting blog</a> than this one. In fact, she even got <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/28/technology/circuits/28blog.html?pagewanted=print&position=top">a mention</a> in the Circuit's section of today's New York Times. Now, whether gender representation is any more inequal in blogs or not, the fact remains that it's pretty cool to get ink in the paper of record.

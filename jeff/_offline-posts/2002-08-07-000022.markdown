In El Salvador, the government will not pay for new construction of schools and classrooms. However, if your town has a facility and no teacher, the government will send someone to teach. <a href="http://www.seedsoflearning.org/">Seeds of Learning</a> is a nonprofit organization dedicated to working with these bureaucracies to enable the building of schools in Latin America, so that more teachers can be assigned to villages in desperate need of structured education. Leslie and I will be in El Salvador for the next two weeks helping out.

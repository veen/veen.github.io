<p class="section">At the intersection of Polk and Vallejo streets in San Francisco, you can
visit four different coffee shops without walking more than 100 feet. The
furthest north, Royal Ground, is filled with terribly hip people pouting over their
novels. The coffee isn't very good and service is worse. Walk south to the
corner and there are two more shops across the street from one another.
Tully's is where people who don't know any better pretend they're snobbier
than the folks in the Starbucks across the way. But the people who anything about
coffee go a few doors further down, to Peet's.</p>

<p>There are always bicycles in front of Peet's -- from restored cruisers and junked
mountain bikes to custom titanium road machines. The conversations at the
sidewalk tables repeats endlessly on matters of derailleurs and linear
pull breaks and sunglasses with replaceable lenses. Every so often, one of
these folks even rides one of those bikes, and usually heads up Polk
toward the bay. After your cofee, you should head that way too.</p>

<p>Riding north through Polk's commercial blocks will take you past dozens of
store fronts. They're always changing, from antiques to restaurants and
back again. The old Alhambra Theatre on the right is now a fitness center with dozens of
people spinning away under the old chandeliers. Further up the shops give
way to apartment buildings, and then to the high school surrounded by
kids sneaking off for a smoke. Taking a left on Francisco rushes you down
a little hill to Van Ness, where you'll inevitably hit the light red, but
the next few blocks give you the rare protection of a bike lane. A right
on Octavia dumps you on Bay and offers the first glimpse of the Golden
Gate. Head toward it, to the right, zig-zagging downhill past a Safeway with the
world's best view.</p>

<p>You'll be on Marina Blvd. now, with the Green stretching out before you
and the bay just beyond. The wind will pick up into your face unless
you've left and some ungodly early hour. And you'll be fighting
rollerblades, runners and strollers on the path or gawking tourists on
the road. Hard to tell which is more dangerous.</p>

<p>Keep pedaling for the bridge, and smile at the new stop signs. Not too long
ago, this was a 45mph commute corridor. The locals convinced the
supervisors that traffic should either slow the hell down or go somewhere
else. The signs went up -- one on every block for six blocks -- and the
place became hospitable again. Of course, the folks from Marin aren't all
that happy about it, but they don't live here, do they?</p>

<p>In a bit, the road will sort of zoom to the left up a ramp to the bridge
proper. That's a freeway for real; stay off it. Rather, point your bike  
straight into the Presidio. It's a national park now, but had been a
military base for as long as there have been Europeans here. The result is
some of the most sought after land in the state, left wide open and free
of development. You'll be riding into Crissy Field, an old air strip
that's undergone a remarkable transformation. Acres of pavement and
concrete were torn up here and replaced with a natural estuary and
parkland. The birds came back and people started coming down here to walk  
their dogs and watch the harbor seals swim by. The thoughtful planners also
included a separate bike path along side Mason St., which you should make use
of now.</p>

<p class="section">The Golden Gate Bridge will be towering before you now, it's orange
supports contrasting against the stunning Marin Headlands. You may also
notice a twisting strip of road cutting up and over the front of those  
hills. That's where you're heading. But you've got to get up there first.</p>

<p>At the end of Crissy Field, the road with fork. Take to the left and then 
an immediate right for your first bit of climbing. If you turn the other
way, you'll immediately see the Presidio Pet Cemetery -- the final resting
place for pets of the base's soldiers. But back to the climb. You can get
your heart rate up a little here by standing and sprinting up the hill.
It's a short, fast ascent. Keep heading up when you intersect Lincoln and  
you'll pass a row of nifty officers homes. They rent these out now.</p>

<p>You'll see signs for the bridge, follow them into the parking lot and up
the bike path next to the gift shop. Watch for pedestrians -- nobody will
be paying attention to you. Decide what side of the bridge you'll take
(based on the time and day you're there) and then get up on the sidewalk
for a stunning mile and a half across. You'll have a great view of where
you just were down in the Marina and an even better view of where you're 
heading.</p>

<p>Depending on what side of the bridge you were on, you'll have some 
options. If you were on the West side, facing the ocean, you'll dump out  
into a parking lot with a road to the right. Climb up the short steep hill
to the stop sign and wait there a minute. If you were on the East side,
facing the city and bay, you'll end up in the scenic overview. You'll have 
to pedal out as if you were getting on the freeway, but you'll actually
ride along side it for a couple hundred yards and the cut back under it
when you hit the road. Now you'll be pedaling back toward the bridge.   
Take the last right turn you can before actually riding onto the freeway 
and you'll be on the right road. A steep little climb and you'll also be
at the stop sign.</p>

<p class="section">Now the fun starts. Take a couple of gulps of water, find a good gear, and
head up the hill. You'll climb steeply at first, but it will level off
soon enough. You'll come around a bend and be at one of the most famous
views you'll ever see -- up on the hill, above the bridge and looking down
on the entrance to the bay. You'll recognize this shot from countless car 
commercials and every image of "scenic San Francisco".</p>

<p>Keep going. You'll climb easily for a while until McCullough Road splits   
off to the right. Stay left and feel your quads as the road steepens   
again. You'll do this for another mile or so until you reach the top. But
you really won't mind, or even notice. On your left, the view will      
amaze you in how it keeps getting better.</p>

<p>The climb peaks out at Hawk Hill, named after the migrating birds who stop
there every year. Someone told me that hawks don't particularly enjoy
flying over open water, so they stop here and circle around and around,   
building the nerve to zip across the mouth of the bay. You can see dozens
sometimes, just making circles and waiting.</p>

<p class="section">Lots of people turn around here. Don't. Right at the end of the little    
parking area, a one-way road disappears around the edge of the hill. Find
yourself a nice big gear and get your hands on the breaks. As you pedal
down around this corner, you'll feel like you're pedaling right off the    
edge of the continent. To say the road drops quickly is laughable. It  
falls right out from under you. Hang on to those breaks and watch your   
speed. It's only one lane and snakes its way through the ocean cliffs with
tight little turns. Catch a glimpse over the edge and watch the waves
explode on the rocks below.</p>

<p>The road will start to undulate over some low hills as you pass old gun 
batteries. There's lots to explore here if you feel like stopping. Every  
hill is carved with hidden machine gun bunkers and other evidence of
military history. You'll pick up some good speed as you drop down into
Rodeo Valley. As the green hills spread out before you down to the ocean,
imagine a subdivision of some 50,000 people here and say a little thank
you to the activists who fought it off. That battle was the impetuous for
the Nature Conservancy, who as been fighting back development ever since.</p>

<p class="section">Eventually, you'll come to a gravel parking lot on your left as the road
intersects. Take two right turns almost immediately and notice the Nike  
missile launch site on your left. You'll drop down to the floor of the
valley and really get some speed up as you pass a road intersecting to the
right. Keep straight and merge onto the main road that makes its way up
the valley and back to the freeway. Stay on this as a few other roads
branch off and you'll soon be to the tunnel. Whack the button and you'll
turn on the flashing "Bike in Tunnel" sign -- whether it does any good to 
the maniacs behind you in their cars is debatable. The tunnel has a nice
grade down which should allow you to push 40mph as you fly through the
darkness. Be sure to let out a holler -- the echo is cool.</p>

<p>Through the tunnel and to the stop sign, you'll take a right and be back 
at the bridge. Retrace your route, again choosing the side that's open at
that time. You're on your way back to the city now. You can follow this
route right on back to Peet's for another cup of coffee, or add a bunch  
more miles in the Presidio and out through Sea Cliff to Ocean Beach.     
Either way, you'll have ridden on of the most spectacular rides in the
area. Let me know how it goes.</p>

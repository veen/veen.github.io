Very drunk. Went with friends to the University Tavern down from the hotel. Hung out with students. It's like the coffee shop at school - very cool. We talked about the war and you and yes, even theater. I even met a guy named Lesley. He's studying acting here. He gave me a smoke.

After, I went to Dyonesius for chips and met some Americans and was embarrassed. Made me ashamed of my country. They were loud and obnoxious and narrow minded. Then I felt guilty because I felt some how better than them. Like after three weeks I'm some sort of authority on how to act in London.

I better get some sleep. Again, I miss you so much it hurts. Being smashed doesn't help one bit.

The U.S. declared war and attacked Iraq tonight. Bush will address the nation soon and we are all glued to the television. We saw video of Heathrow Airport where we are to fly out next week. There are troops guarding the terminals and tanks on the field. They are worrying about terrorism. I don't know if I should worry or not.

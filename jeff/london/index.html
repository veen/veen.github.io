<blockquote>

In 1991, I joined 20 other students on a month-long intensive study of theater in London, England. I was 21 years old and recently engaged to be married. One week into the trip, the United States declared war on Iraq, starting the highly publicized and wildly popular gulf war. As a young American in a foreign country, I was offered a unique perspective on what was to become a media spectacle back home. I spent that month with a video camera, wandering around the city, going to theatrical productions every night, and talking to anyone I could. These</a> are my letters home to my future wife, Leslie.

    <p>I'm a Design Partner and Head of Platform at True Ventures, where I spend my time helping founders create better products. I do this as an advisor, as well, for companies like about.me, Medium, and WordPress. Previously, I was VP of Design at Adobe after they acquired Typekit, the company I co-founded and ran as CEO.</p>

    <p>I was also one of the founding partners of the user experience consulting group Adaptive Path. While there, I led Measure Map, which was acquired by Google. During my time at Google, I designed Google Analytics and led the UX team for Google's apps.</p>

    <p>Much earlier, I was part of the founding web team at Wired Magazine, where I helped build HotWired, Web Monkey, Wired News, and many other sites. During that time, I authored two books, "HotWired Style" and "The Art and Science of Web Design."</p>

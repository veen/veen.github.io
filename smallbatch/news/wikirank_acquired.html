<h2>Wikirank Acquired by Brizzly</h2>

<p>All of us at Small Batch Inc are excited to announce that <a href="http://wikirank.com/">Wikirank</a> has been acquired by our friends at <a href="http://brizzly.com">Brizzly</a>. They are integrating the work we've done on visualizing Wikipedia trends into the <a href="http://brizzly.com/guide">Brizzly Guide</a>, a new site designed to help navigate what people are talking about on Twitter, Facebook, and other social spaces.</p>

<p>It's a perfect fit. As we said when we <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000998.html">launched Wikirank</a>, our goal has always been to build things that help  make sense of the enormous amount of information that bombards us each day. The Brizzly Guide is designed to do just that. As more and more conversation is shared through social media, tools like this will help us see patterns and take the pulse of our networked world.</p>

<p>We created Small Batch to explore what is now possible on the web. You can see this in our work on the <a href="http://thestartconference.com/">Start Conference</a>, our collaboration with <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2008/09/of-people-by-people-for-people.html">Twitter</a>, and the launch and incredible growth of <a href="http://typekit.com/">Typekit</a>.</p>

<p>We were proud of Wikirank when we built it, and are pleased to see it live on in such capable hands.</p>

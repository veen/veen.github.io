      <h1>Hello, I’m Greg Veen.</h1>
      <p>
        I’m a product manager and entrepreneur in San Francisco, California,
        where I co-founded the digital product design and development company
        Crayon Industries.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also co-founded the web font service Typekit, which was acquired by
        Adobe, and I later served as Adobe’s Head of Product for Typekit (now
        named Adobe Fonts) and Type.
      </p>
      <p>
        Earlier, I was the first employee for the blog analytics tool Measure
        Map, which was acquired by Google, and then I worked at Google
        designing, prototyping and developing Google Analytics and Gmail. Before
        that, I led the front-end development team at early social media company
        Tickle, which was acquired by Monster.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve also consulted for companies including Twitter, the Corporation for
        Public Broadcasting, Mule Design Studio, and Adaptive Path.
      </p>
      <p>
        I published some <a href="archives/index.html">blog posts</a> here in
        the past. Here’s some more stuff from me:

<title>Wikirank: What&apos;s popular on Wikipedia</title>
<link>http://www.veen.com/greg/archives/000999.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>The four of us at <a href="http://smallbatchinc.com/">Small Batch Inc</a> have launched our first product!  It's <a href="http://wikirank.com/">Wikirank</a>, a tool that shows you what's popular on Wikipedia and lets you compare topics and share your findings with the world.  It's already uncovered some interesting stories -- and some surprises.  Take this comparison, for example, showing relative interest in the members of the totally awesome Canadian prog rock band, <a href="http://wikirank.com/en/Rush_(band)">Rush</a>:</p>

<div class="wikirank-embed"><p><a href="http://wikirank.com/en/Geddy_Lee,Alex_Lifeson,Neil_Peart?date=20090326">Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neil Peart</a> on <a href="http://wikirank.com/">Wikirank</a></p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="http://e.wikirank.com/wr.js"></script>

<p>What, you expected front-man Geddy Lee to come out on top?  Not so!  But, really, we all know Neil Peart is the true creative genius of the three.  (And, um, I may have just revealed too much about my interest in this band.  Moving along...)</p>

<p>Try it out for yourself at <a href="http://wikirank.com">Wikirank</a>, and <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/smallbatchinc/products/smallbatchinc_wikirank">let us know</a> what you think.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>On the news of Fidel Castro's resignation, President Bush called for "free and fair" elections in Cuba:</p>

<blockquote>
"The international community should work with the Cuban people to begin to build institutions that are necessary for democracy," he said. "Eventually, this transition ought to lead to free and fair elections -- and I mean free, and I mean fair -- not these kind of staged elections that the Castro brothers try to foist off as true democracy."
</blockquote>

<p>I wish I could take him seriously.  Yes, of course Cuba should have free and fair elections.  But of all the people to be calling for them...</p>

<title>Google Analytics redesign lifts off</title>
<link>http://www.veen.com/greg/archives/000966.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Yes, the redesign of <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> has <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/05/whole-new-experience-for-google.html">launched</a>, and I'm very happy with how it turned out!  As <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000965.html">Jeff</a> and <a href="http://fivesevensix.com/posts/2007/05/08/omg-it-launched">Ryan</a> and others have already mentioned, getting here was indeed a challenge.  But it was the kind of challenge I love, shaped by constraints pushing and pulling from all sorts of fascinating angles -- and, very importantly, faced head on by a tremendous team of talented people.  Big thanks to all involved!  </p>

<p>If you use Google Analytics, let me know what you think of the redesign.  The new version will roll out to all accounts over the next month or so.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>While riding a packed bus the other day, I heard something drop to the floor -- something small, like a coin maybe.  I looked down, and sure enough:  there, among passengers' feet, I saw a coin spinning to rest.  But it was a big coin.  And it was purple.</p>

<p>I was standing at the time, but the man sitting in front of me reached down and grabbed the coin.  Then he looked up at me and, from a mouth subtly outlined with almost gelatinous saliva, said what turned out to be the most entertaining thing I'd heard all day:</p>

<p>"It's my lucky travel coin," he epxlained.  He paused for a second or two before continuing.  "I'm having trouble recovering the disk drive because, well, you know, we're like <em>in</em> it."</p>

<p>I couldn't really disagree.  As I nodded back he added, "So, you know, I don't really want to reformat it or reboot."</p>

<p>So very true.</p>]]></description>

<title>Objectifying Javascript</title>
<link>http://www.veen.com/greg/archives/000947.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>While catching up on some of the blog reading that my recently busy schedule has forced me to neglect, I came across Jonathan Snook's <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/articles/objectifying_javascript/" title="Digital Web Magazine - Objectifying JavaScript">summary of object oriented Javascript</a>, which was published over at <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/" title="Digital Web Magazine">Digital Web</a> last September.  It does a great job of outlining various approaches towards objected oriented Javascript that have spread in use as web applications have grown more sophisticated.  I  really wish this had been around for me to read ages ago, when my development work first headed in that direction.</p>]]></description>

<p>Ours is a perilous time, apparently: since the group's inception, members have posted nearly 4,000 photos of  "warning signs showing stick figures in dangerous, often life-threatening, situations" (as the group's original description puts it). Here's the awesome photo that started it all:</p>

<title>Band of Horses</title>
<link>http://www.veen.com/greg/archives/000893.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bandofhorses.com/" title="Band of Horses' official web site">Band of Horses</a> has recorded some wonderful, wonderful rock and roll on <em><a href="http://www.mp3.com/albums/20092549/summary.html" title="Everything All The Time album review at mp3.com">Everything All The Time</a></em>.  On first listen, I couldn't get over the obvious comparison to <a href="http://www.theshins.com/" title="The Shins' official web site">The Shins</a> -- for one, Ben Bridwell's voice sounds an awful lot like James Mercer's -- and, frankly, the similarities between the two bands was reason enough for me to take an almost automatic (though still tentative) liking to them early on.  But as I've settled in to this record, that comparison has receeded into the background, and I've realized how great some of these songs really are.</p>

<p>"The Funeral" is one of the best of the songs.  It's got this great line, belted out over and over: "At every occasion, I'll be ready for a funeral."  Amazingly, this doesn't come across as corny;  in fact, it's incredible and powerful and -- I want to be careful to not be corny here myself, but -- almost majestic.  <em>Majesty</em>: it's the word the <a href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/b/band-of-horses/everything-all-the-time.shtml" title="Band of Horses: Everything All the Time: Pitchfork Review">Pitchfork review</a> uses, which puts it better than I can:  "Turning despondency into indie majesty is a major talent of Band of Horses; their music is carefully balanced to evoke specific emotional responses while allowing space for personal projection."</p>

<p>Ok, so I think all this talk <em>has</em> gotten a little corny.  Just go listen to this great record.  And listen closely.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>I've been looking for a band with a very specific sound, and I think I've found it in Forward, Russia: they're what it would sound like if you crammed early-stage U2 into a tiny cage and repeatedly jabbed them with a stick until they could no longer contain their rage.  Just <em>listen</em> to their track "Fifteen, Part 2".  Wow!  Rock and roll: I love you.</p>]]></description>

<title>Dim lights</title>
<link>http://www.veen.com/greg/archives/000878.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>During a cab ride across town the other day, my cab driver told me the city had dimmed the traffic lights the night before.  He said the stop signals weren't their usual red -- they were <em>orange</em>.  </p>

<p>Weird.  I'd never heard of that.  I asked him why on earth the city would do such a thing.  </p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I think they're trying to make up for the fact that they don't have enough police out on the streets."  </p>

<p>Huh?  </p>

<p>Oh, wait: does it cause people to pay a little closer attention while driving or something like that?  Sure, the idea seemed far-fetched, but it's all that came to mind at the time.</p>

<p>"No, no" my driver explained," actually, it makes people <em>sleepy</em>."</p>

<p>Oh.  </p>

<p>Right.  </p>

<p>That's when I realized I was engaged in one <em>incredibly interesting</em> conversation.</p>

<p>He reiterated:  "Yep, they don't have enough cops out here, so they dim the lights to make us tired, keep us in line."</p>

<p>And yes, at this point, maybe part of me thought I should say something along the lines of "Oh, you know what?  Actually, I want to get out here.  Yeah, right here.  Here's my stop!  Thanks!"</p>

<p>But I didn't.</p>]]></description>

<h2>Pause</h2>
<p>Apologies to those who aren't located in San Francisco or who have no interest in San Francisco politics, but I must pause for a moment to endorse Matt Gonzalez for mayor of San Francisco in the upcoming December 9 runoff election.</p>

<p>This may sound crazy, but the fact that Matt Gonzalez even has a chance of being the next mayor of San Francisco brings me a new sense of hope with respect to politics.  Even if it is <em>just San Francisco</em>, I feel some measure of comfort knowing that good still has a chance of prevailing in a political landscape shaped by such disheartening events as the absolutely ludicrous outcome of the presidential election in 2000, the deception of the American people regarding the threat posed by Iraq, and Arnold Schwarzenegger's frightening rise to power in California.</p>

<p>Why Matt?  <a href="http://www.mattgonzalez.com/">See for yourself</a>.</p>

<p>
Thanks,<br />

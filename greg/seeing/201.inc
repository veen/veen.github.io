<p>An approach to the visual that treats images as constructed artifacts rather than as objective windows is increasingly apparent today in the use and reception of digital images.  The notion that images are constructed from constituent meaningful elements is foregrounded when images are digital: the ease with which specific elements from digital images can be cut and pasted and modified using today's image editing software draws attention both to their own status as individual carriers of meaning and to the ways in which the meaning of the composition in which those elements appear is in some ways conditioned by their combined synthesis, by how they are arranged.  After the arrival of image editing and production software like Adobe Photoshop (see Figure 2.1), the presence and appearance of any graphical element in an image becomes newly significant, simply because it could have so easily been seamlessly cut out or modified.  Applications like Photoshop not only offer an impressive array of <i>inscription</i> tools (many of which rely on metaphors that refer to traditional technologies of art--paint brushes, pencils, canvas cropping devices, and so on).  They also make possible the addition and modification of "natural" qualities like highlights, shadows, and surface textures as independent variables (managed, in an extension of the physical metaphor, as "layers").  Some applications--Photoshop included--can even generate "realistic"-looking objects that are nevertheless entirely digitally-rendered.  Now, an image of a sphere (or a cloud, or a dinosaur) may look "real", but it doesn't necessarily correspond to an "actual" object in the "real" world.  Even viewers who have never had much reason to concern themselves with the so-called modern crisis of representation find themselves now encountered by a literal instantiation of the theoretical bankruptcy of correspondence.</p>

<p>As a number of "postphotography" theorists have pointed out, this effectively spells the end of photography--or, more accurately, of a specific way of perceiving photography's ability to represent "reality" faithfully.  As Roy Ascott <a href="main.php?sectionID=500&citation=ascott&returnID=<%=sectionID%>&anchorID=ascott1" name="ascott1">suggests</a>, digital technology's undercutting of the photograph's status as trustworthy purveyor of reality diverts our interest away from what photographs <i>mean</i> and redirects it toward <i>how</i> they mean--how they are meaningfully constructed rather than how they point or correspond to a meaning.  As Ascott states in reference to art photography, in an era of postphotographic practice "empathy with an artwork's evocation of a given state, or a given fragment of the here and now, is of less importance to us than a vivid involvement, through our interaction with the photodata image, in the construction of a reality, of multiple realities.  In postphotographic practice, the lust for verisimilitude gives way to the love of construction."  After photography--that is, once any image is of potentially digital and hence constructed origin--even "photo-realistic" images share the status that new visual literacies recognize in simpler, more obviously <i>drawn</i> images.  Images are meaningfully-arranged constructions, not translations.</p>

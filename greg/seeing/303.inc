<p>Nicholas Burbules' recent <a href="main.php?sectionID=500&citation=burbules&returnID=<%=sectionID%>&anchorID=burbules1" name="burbules1">study</a> of the hypertext link and critical literacy is one particularly promising source of hypertext link theory that might usefully be applied to linked images.  Burbules suggests that the experience of reading hypertext can promote a signficant kind of critical literacy, a way of reading that involves paying close attention to the use and placement of links and to the assumptions these practices reveal.  According to Burbules, once the link is problematized--once readers, that is, view the link more as productive of meaning in itself than as a neutral medium between two meaningful points--readers can see links as "associative relations that change, redefine, and enhance or restrict access to the information they comprise" (103).  Links, in this view, do not just carry readers from one text to another, remaining independent of the reader's experience of meaning-making; links are, in fact, active participants in that experience.</p>

<p>This approach to links bears significant similarities to the approach to images associated with the "new" visual literacy.  In both cases, <i>surfaces</i> are considered at least as meaningful as <i>depth</i>: the mediating mechanism itself, whether a link or an image, becomes a real site for the production of meaning rather than remaining a transparent connector or window.  It is this similarity which suggests that an approach to hypertext links like Burbules' is also in some important ways a suitable way to approach images that contain or function as links: the rhetorical inscription of links into images is a practice that can find (and, I suggest, is finding) a welcome home among the growing repertoire of visual grammar tools that are also increasingly viewed as functioning rhetorically.  Likewise, a way of reading hypermedia that is aware of how links are used rhetorically would be (and again I suggest, is becoming) open to considering how images (and especially <i>linked</i> images) might also be used rhetorically.  My suggestion here is that the awareness reader/viewers have of the increasingly stronger role images now perform in meaning-making processes helps to denaturalize their experience of the visual click-through in ways inevitably similar to their increasingly sophisticated approaches to links in general. Put simply, the "new visual literacy" that those like Kress and van Leeuwen describe and the practice of "critical hyperreading" that those like Burbules describe are a perfect match.  In visually saturated, massively networked hypermedia environments like the Web, they are in fact working together to form something like a "visual hyperliteracy."  

<p>In his study, Burbules suggests some questions to consider when critically confronting links.  "A thoughtful hyperreader," he says--and we might substitute hyperviewer--"asks why links are made from certain points and not others; where those links lead; and what values are entailed in such decisions.  But beyond this, links create significations themselves: they are not simply the neutral medium of passing from point A to point B." (110)  Applying this approach to linked images might lead us to ask questions like the following:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>What meaning is generated when one part of an image-map is a link and another is not?  
<li>What meaning is generated when one <i>image</i> is a link and another is not?  
<li>What claim is being made, implicit or otherwise, about the meaning of an image (or particular region of an image-map) by linking it to some particular information?  And vice versa: what claim is being made about the meaning of the destination of a link by linking to it from an image (or a particular region of an image-map)?
</ul></p>

<p>The details of Burbules' description of how hypertext links work rhetorically suggests one way of framing such questions.  According to Burbules, links can be read as rhetorical tropes--as language-like forms that have specific meaning effects.  Links can be read as metaphors, for example, "when apparently unrelated textual elements are associated: a link from a page listing Political Organisations to a page on the Catholic Church might puzzle, outrage, or be ignored--but considered as a metaphor it might make a reader think about politics and religion in a different way" (111). This sort of practice of association clearly constitutes a rhetorical use of metaphor, which, as Martha Kolln <a href="main.php?sectionID=500&citation=kolln&returnID=<%=sectionID%>&anchorID=kolln1" name="kolln1">points out</a>, is a deliberate bypassing of heirarchies of meaning, involving a transfer of meaning from one branch to another significantly different branch.  Just as, for example, calling an <i>interstate highway</i> a <i>river</i> changes the meaning of an <i>interstate highway</i> by transfering to it some of the meaning of <i>river</i> (and also, but somewhat less so, the other way around), so also suggesting a meaningful similarity between the <i>Catholic Church</i> and the notion of a <i>political organization</i> using a hypertext link in the context Burbules describes would make a claim (in some contexts, provocative) about the Church's meaning.</p>

<p>Visual click-throughs can also work rhetorically as metaphors. Obviously, this is most evident when the images involved are stylized icons that function explicity as interface elements.  Like the now rather pervasive and naturalized "desktop" operating system metaphor (i.e., "this process of encountering your data is in some important ways similar to using a physical desktop"), hypermedia interface icons use the familiar characteristics of the physical things they depict to help describe the destination they link to.  The "home" metaphor is by far the most common (and, for that reason, one of the most metonymically powerful) uses of this kind of hypermedia rhetoric.  By linking back to the first page users encounter when visiting a Website, icons like those shown below in Figure 3.2 (built into Netscape Navigator [left] and Internet Explorer [right] and often appropriated for use as Website icons) transfer some of the meaning of the concept of a <i>home</i> to the meaning of the <i>front page</i>, or <i>home page</i>, of a site: it is a starting point, a familiar space, a kind of base that should contain general, foundational information.</p>

<p>One could certainly critique the narrowly Western way such icons represent the concept of <i>home</i> and the way this invokes heirarchical information categories.  As Gunther Kress <a href="main.php?sectionID=500&citation=kress&returnID=<%=sectionID%>&anchorID=kress1" name="kress1">suggests</a>, the visual is "as much formed by differences of culture as the verbal is" (57).  But even a less critical approach no longer views such images essentialistically, as mere objective vehicles for conveying meaning: the fact that the icons are linked gives them a kind of agency in the meaning-making process.  Here, image and link work together with what viewers know about homes to produce meaning.</p>

<p>The same is the case of uses of linked icons that represent--and comment upon--actions.  The icon/word combinations shown below in Figure 3.3, for example, function as user interface elements in a Web-based email application.  These elements do not solely "point" to the action they are linked to--the linked text alone could do that.  They also change the notion of <i>deleting an email message</i> by likening it to the notion of <i>discarding a physical piece of paper</i>, and they make understandable the multi-layered action of accessing a mail server via various transfer protocols and rendering complex data displayable in a Web browser: it's called "getting mail", and, in the end, it's something like transfering paper documents into a physical file folder.</p>

<p>Visual click-through metaphors similarly make understandable the immensely complex sets of digital transactions that power today's ecommerce Websites.  Many of these sites use the now-familiar shopping cart or shopping bag icons as links that enable users to see the list of products they have chosen during a shopping session (see Figures 3.4 and 3.5 below).  This hypermedia metaphor suggests important similarities between physical shopping carts/bags and the layers of coded electric impulses that work behind the scenes to make possible an experience of Web-driven commodity consumption.  When at a brick-and-mortar store, shoppers can review their orders by looking in their carts or bags;  on the Web, shoppers need only click on the cart or bag icon to exectue the string of operations that will display the products they have selected while shopping.</p>

<p>The increasingly widespread deployment of this kind of consumption-enabling hypermedia rhetoric demonstrates an important way in which the hypermedia click-through has been appropriated as a site for the making of ideologies of consumption.  (The term <i>click-through</i> is, in fact, <a href="http://www.advertising.com/glossary/index.html#c">well established in the Web advertising world</a>.  The click-through rate is a factor used to determine the effectiveness of Web-based advertising: how many users actually click on a particular ad banner, for example?)  A careful reading of ecommerce hypermedia rhetoric reveals the ways in which it positions users as particular types of subjects.  To be sure, the use of hypermedia rhetoric as a tool for making the processes underlying digital commerce seamless and understandable seems to grant users a certain agency: the Web's product selection is virtually limitless, and online retailers compete fiercely for the patronage of users who have an immense power to choose--the next ecommerce site is just a click or a keystroke away, after all.  But it is exactly this kind of hyperconsumption that <a href="main.php?sectionID=600&returnID=<%=sectionID%>&anchorID=can" name="can">can</a> objectify users as consumers, as subjects who freely accept their role in the engine of late capitalist production and consumption.  Once appropriated by commodity culture, the click-through may indeed be the ultimate act of consumption: it is quick, painless, and--now in select cities--it can <a href="http://www.kozmo.com/">deliver products to your door in under an hour</a>.</p>

<p>The way in which digital images are increasingly viewed as being constituted by elements combined in a way that reveals a particular perspective at work is also bolstered by many viewers' awareness that digital images literally <i>are</i> composed of constituent parts--the individual screen pixels, the dots they're made of, represented at the code-level by the digital bits of data that give "digital" images their name.  Granted, the fact that digital images are composed of bit-controlled pixels may at first actually seem to grant them a kind of perceived immediacy, a direct connection to the represented thing that circumvents interference from subjectivities: as Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin <a href="main.php?sectionID=500&citation=boltergrusin&returnID=<%=sectionID%>&anchorID=boltergrusin1" name="boltergrusin1">point out</a>, by automating the process of image production, computers, like cameras, can seem to remove the human agent from that process.  Because so much of what goes into the production of a digital image is the machine-level processing of essentially redundant numerical data, a knowledge of digital image production processes may lead some to perceive such images as in fact quite objective, offering the viewer a kind of immediate experience of what the images point to, rather than, as I'm suggesting, an experience that's explicitly mediated by emerging conventions of visual representation rhetorically deployed by graphic designers.  When it comes down to it, a bit is after all just a bit, a monad-like thing that has no meaning in isolation.</p>

<p>But it is precisely this characteristic that allows bits to be deliberately coded, combined in ways that result in the display of pixels that form the meaningful components of an image.  "Pixels," <a href="main.php?sectionID=500&citation=kurtz&returnID=<%=sectionID%>&anchorID=kurtz1" name="kurtz1">says Glenn Kurtz</a>, "are electronic pointillism."  And the processes of automatic bit-routing set in motion when a designer uses a graphics application to render clouds, for example, are in the end just more layers of mediation in the process of making images, which has always been to some degree mediated: using digital rendering tools is more like using a brush instead of fingers when painting than it is some sort of wholesale removal of subjectivities from image production.  Just as paint brushes produce certain kinds of strokes, digital filters and rendering tools have certain display effects--"strokes" that now happen to be bigger and more complex.  This is a question of scale: the unit of inscription has changed, not inscription itself.</p>

<p>A growing understanding among viewers of these kinds of characteristics of digital images (and of the implications they have for potentially <i>all</i> images being produced today) leads viewers, then, to a realization that images are inherently meaning productive rather than merely meaning conductive: images do not just transparently point to the "real", objectively delivering some corresponding meaning; they are "real" in themselves, made of parts consciously arranged to convey a particular message.  The use--and awarenesses of the use--of digital imaging technologies thus reconfirms, participates in, and extends the emerging visual literacies that have responded to the increasing presence and importance of images in public practices of signification.  Uses of these technologies have, in short, helped further to change our understanding of images by affording us new ways of making meaning with images.</p>

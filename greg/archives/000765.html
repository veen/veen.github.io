      <h1>Brand New Colony</h1>

      <h2>11 August 2005</h2>

      <p>
        People generally don't pay enough attention to song lyrics, I've
        decided. Why that is, I don't understand. I mean, really, just read
        these lyrics from <em>Brand New Colony</em> by
        <a
          href="http://www.mp3.com/the-postal-service/artists/507880/summary.html"
          title="The Postal Service MP3, Songs and Albums"
          >The Postal Service</a
        >. Go on, read them:
      </p>

      <p>
        I'll be the grapes fermented, bottled and<br />
        served with the table set in my finest suit<br />
        like a perfect gentleman.<br />
        I'll be the fire escape that's bolted to the<br />
        ancient brick where you will sit<br />
        and contemplate your day.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'll be the waterwings that save you if you<br />
        start drowning in an open tab when your<br />
        judgment's on the brink.<br />
        I'll be the phonograph that plays your favorite<br />
        albums back as you're lying there, drifting off<br />
        to sleep... Drifting off to sleep...<br />
        I'll be the platform shoes; undo what heredity's done to you:<br />
        you won't have to strain to look into my eyes.<br />
        I'll be your winter coat, buttoned and zipped<br />
        straight to the throat with the collar up so<br />
        you won't catch a cold.
      </p>

      <p>
        I want to take you far from the cynics in this town<br />
        and kiss you on the mouth.<br />
        We'll cut our bodies free from the tethers of<br />
        this scene, start a brand new colony.<br />
        Where everything will change, we'll give<br />
        ourselves new names. Identities erased.<br />
        The sun will heat the grounds, under our bare<br />
        feet in this brand new colony.<br />
        Brand new colony...
      </p>

      <p>
        Everything will change.<br />
        Everything will change.<br />
        Everything will change.
      </p>

            The song is great, but classic Postal Service where you want so
            badly to feel like the expressionist lyrics mean something to YOU.
            In the end, he's just screwing with you.

            I am doing a paper on The Glass Menagerie and I read that this song
            is speculared to based off of the play by Tennessee Williams. So
            there's some more info for ya. Thanks for the song. Everything is
            blocked from the school online.

      <h1>Web development basics</h1>

      <h2>27 March 2006</h2>

      <p>
        Those of us who design and build for the web have witnessed some
        exciting changes in our field over the past few years. We've seen
        traction in the web standards movement, a spreading commitment to
        accessibility, the growth of web services, the emergence of Ajax, the
        development of time-saving code frameworks and libraries, and more. But
        how does it all fit together? As we pursue the <em>next</em> new and
        exciting development, how do we avoid taking for granted the amazing
        infrastructure all these changes have left us with?
      </p>

      <p>
        Whenever I start a new project -- and from time to time during ongoing
        ones -- I take a step back to review the web development basics. What
        priorities should guide my work? Given the landscape of ways the web is
        accessed today, what core design and development requirements should I
        meet? What advice would I give to others in the same situation?
      </p>

      <p>
        Well then, here are a few recommendations, for myself and those like me.
        This discussion will be mostly about
        <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end"
          title="Front-end and back-end - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"
          >front-end</a
        >
        technical priorities, so the main back-end/infrastructural
        recommendation I'd make is to use systems (like
        <a href="http://drupal.org/" title="drupal.org | Community plumbing"
          >Drupal</a
        >
        for content management, say) that don't unnecessarily get in the way of
        realizing your front-end goals. For example: don't use a CMS that
        inserts invalid code into your documents!
      </p>

      <p>
        Above all else, make sure that your site declares a document type
        (preferably at least XHTML 1.0 Strict) and that its HTML and CSS
        validate against the W3C's
        <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/"
          title="The W3C QA Toolbox - Validators, checkers and other tools for Webmasters and Web Developers"
          >validators</a
        >. As I've
        <a href="/greg/archives/000634.html" title="Why XHTML? | Greg Veen"
          >discussed</a
        >
        before, this is simply the best way to keep your code lean and
        maintainable, and it sets an essential foundation for everything else
        I'm about to describe.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond that core of valid markup and CSS, your site should also meet web
        accessibility guidelines and standards, such as the W3C's
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php" title="WCAG Overview"
          >Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a
        >
        and the federal government's
        <a
          href="http://www.section508.gov/"
          title="Section 508: The Road to Accessibility"
          >Section 508</a
        >
        standards. You can use various
        <a
          href="http://www.contentquality.com/"
          title="Welcome to the HiSoftware Cynthia Says Portal"
          >tests</a
        >
        to check your site's compliance to these guidelines and standards.
      </p>

      <p>
        But what's actually far more important than letter-of-the-law adherence
        to those guideline checklists is that your site really is designed and
        developed, from the beginning, with accessibility in mind. Keep the
        interface simple; organize and order content logically and meaningfully;
        and make sure the site makes sense in alternate browsing devices, like
        screen readers. On a markup level, this would mean direct, uncluttered
        code that's structured into semantically meaningful elements like
        headings, paragraphs, and lists rather than lots of meaningless divs and
        spans -- or worse, presentational elements like nested layout tables, hr
        tags, and images that contain text. Plus, if you use markup correctly,
        the site will not only be more accessible, but it will tend to rank
        higher in search engine results as well. I've found that
        <a
          href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/"
          title="Dive Into Accessibility"
          >Dive into Accessibility</a
        >
        among others can help keep you on track when it comes to these sorts of
        common sense, real-world accessibility strategies. Example: a "skip to
        main content" link is important if your site includes a list of
        navigational links at the top of each page. Many major sites still don't
        have one.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for browsers, you basically want to support them all. This doesn't
        mean that every hi-fi detail of your site has to work in, say, Netscape
        3, of course. It just means that, ideally, browsers that don't support
        the latest standards will still be presented with a usable site --
        perhaps unstyled, if they don't support css-based layouts, and perhaps
        not Ajax-enabled, if their Javascript support is lacking -- but
        informative and usable nevertheless. So the advanced features of your
        site should either look and function their best, or be stripped down.
        And the thing is, you can still end up providing the best experience to
        most of your site's visitors: just be sure to test advanced features in
        at least IE6, Firefox/Mozilla, Safari, and Opera 8, and you'll be
        covering most people. Ideally, you'll also test in Windows IE5/5.5 and
        IE 5.2 Mac, though there's been some debate as to whether accommodating
        the quirks of these browsers, especially Win IE5/5.2, is worth the all
        the hacks and extra effort necessary.
      </p>

      <p>
        And that about sums it up. Yes, of course there's so much more beyond
        this. But I've found that resisting compromise on these basic guidelines
        helps keep projects sane and sites usable, even as the web continues to
        evolve in newer, more exciting directions.

          <p>Wow - a real post! And it's a good one too!</p>

          <p>
            As far as browser compatability goes, I like Yahoo's graded
            approach, where you establish A, B and C level experiences and make
            sure that browsers within that grade level are supported fully for
            that experience. If you build you presentation framework in such a
            way that it abstracts the actual nuts and bolts of it, then
            developing this way isn't hard.
          </p>

          <p>Oh - and I've stopped using HRs, thanks to you. :)</p>

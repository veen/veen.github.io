      <h1>Dim lights</h1>

      <h2>12 April 2006</h2>

      <p>
        During a cab ride across town the other day, my cab driver told me the
        city had dimmed the traffic lights the night before. He said the stop
        signals weren't their usual red -- they were <em>orange</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Weird. I'd never heard of that. I asked him why on earth the city would
        do such a thing.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Well," he said, "I think they're trying to make up for the fact that
        they don't have enough police out on the streets."
      </p>

      <p>Huh?</p>

      <p>
        Oh, wait: does it cause people to pay a little closer attention while
        driving or something like that? Sure, the idea seemed far-fetched, but
        it's all that came to mind at the time.
      </p>

      <p>
        "No, no" my driver explained," actually, it makes people
        <em>sleepy</em>."
      </p>

      <p>Oh.</p>

      <p>Right.</p>

      <p>
        That's when I realized I was engaged in one
        <em>incredibly interesting</em> conversation.
      </p>

      <p>
        He reiterated: "Yep, they don't have enough cops out here, so they dim
        the lights to make us tired, keep us in line."
      </p>

      <p>
        And yes, at this point, maybe part of me thought I should say something
        along the lines of "Oh, you know what? Actually, I want to get out here.
        Yeah, right here. Here's my stop! Thanks!"
      </p>

      <p>But I didn't.</p>

          <p>I love the crazies.</p>

          <p>
            The question, of course, is: where's the Google-bus when you need
            it.

            Are you sure you didn't just dream this? It sounds like a dream
            conversation to me.

          <p>What part of this doesn't make ABSOLUTELY PERFECT sense?</p>

          <p>
            I feel suspicious of the people around me even as I type this....

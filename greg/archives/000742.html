      <h1>Seriously, man, it's really important</h1>

      <h2>25 June 2005</h2>

      <p>
        I saw

          >The Mountain Goats</a
        >
        for the first time Thursday night, and wow did they put on a spectacular
        show at the
        <a href="http://www.bottomofthehill.com/" title="Bottom of the Hill"
          >Bottom of the Hill</a
        >. They even invited Mr.

        and his guitar to the stage for a song or two.
      </p>

      <p>
        And the audience? Chock <em>full</em> of hipsters. I must say, though,
        they were considerably more alive than other
        <a

          title="Return of the trucker-hatted indie zombies | Greg Veen"
          >hipster audiences I've mentioned here</a
        >. In fact, maybe some of them were a little <em>too</em> into it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shortly after the Goats got back on stage for an encore, I stepped out
        to the patio for some fresh air. A few songs later, the music stopped,
        and out walked

        and

          href="http://www.johnvanderslice.com/html/2005_mtngoats/peter.html"

          >Peter Hughes</a

        themselves. Amped from an intense performance (or was it the
        <a href="http://mountain-goats.com/bio.html" title="The Mountain Goats"
          >crank</a
        >?), John yelled to Peter, "Hey, did we bring both whiskies?" (Fans had
        been showering them with drinks all night.) After getting only a shrug
        from Peter in response, John turned around (probably weighing the
        physical and emotional cost of playing a second encore against the
        benefit of retrieving that whisky), only to be confronted by a hipster
        who'd appeared as if from thin air.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Thanks, John! Thank you so much," said the hipster, who then gave John
        a nice long hug.
      </p>

      <p>"Hey, you're welcome, man. Thanks for coming to the show."</p>

      <p>
        "Wouldn't have missed it," replied the hipster. "Say, I have a
        question."
      </p>

      <p>"Um. No, I can't really answer any questions right now."</p>

      <p>
        "But, seriously, man, it's really important! You know that song with the
        line..."
      </p>

      <p>
        "No, I said <em>I can't answer any questions right now</em>." John
        motioned to Peter, and they rushed back inside.
      </p>

      <p>"But, but..."</p>

      <p>
        The hipster sounded panicked. He looked around in desperation, searching
        for someone to answer his burning question. He locked in another hipster
        nearby.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Hey, you know that song with the line about being in the living room
        watching the Watergate hearings?"
      </p>

      <p>"Yeah, man, totally. I love that one!"</p>

      <p>"What do you think he means when he says..."</p>

      <p>
        Now, while I'm sure this conversation would prove to be wildly engaging,
        I'm afraid their voices trailed off as I followed John and Peter back
        inside for more rock and roll. And whisky.

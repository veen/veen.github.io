      <h1>We're in it</h1>

      <h2>7 January 2007</h2>

      <p>
        While riding a packed bus the other day, I heard something drop to the
        floor -- something small, like a coin maybe. I looked down, and sure
        enough: there, among passengers' feet, I saw a coin spinning to rest.
        But it was a big coin. And it was purple.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was standing at the time, but the man sitting in front of me reached
        down and grabbed the coin. Then he looked up at me and, from a mouth
        subtly outlined with almost gelatinous saliva, said what turned out to
        be the most entertaining thing I'd heard all day:
      </p>

      <p>
        "It's my lucky travel coin," he epxlained. He paused for a second or two
        before continuing. "I'm having trouble recovering the disk drive
        because, well, you know, we're like <em>in</em> it."
      </p>

      <p>
        I couldn't really disagree. As I nodded back he added, "So, you know, I
        don't really want to reformat it or reboot."
      </p>

      <p>So very true.</p>

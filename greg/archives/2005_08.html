      <h1>Crack pipes</h1>

      <h2>16 August 2005</h2>

      <p>
        I own a 1972 Honda CB500/4 motorbike, and I park it on the street in my
        wonderful neighborhood, the
        <a
          href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=94117&ll=37.771851,-122.433422&spn=0.003698,0.007135&t=h&hl=en"
          >Lower Haight district of San Francisco</a
        >. The problem? The bike's sparkplugs keep disappearing. I'm told that
        urban crack addicts are notorious for breaking off the top piece of
        exposed sparkplugs (like mine) because, in a pinch, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkplug#Insulator"
          >ceramic part</a
        >
        makes a decent crack pipe.
      </p>

      <p>
        I recently lost two sparkplugs to the crackheads in under a week, so I
        really started thinking hard about how to put an end to this nonsense. I
        mean, come on, I've had my bike <em>towed</em> because a missing
        sparkplug kept me from moving it. And even though I now keep a stock of
        replacements on board to prevent that from ever happening again, new
        plugs aren't exactly a dime a dozen nowadays. This is not an inexpensive
        problem to have.
      </p>

      <p>
        In thinking about this, I realized that short of garaging the bike,
        really the only way to solve my problem would be to provide a more
        appealing (and cheaper!) alternative to smoking crack through a spark
        plug. And that's how I found myself in a very strange position -- one
        that, quite frankly, I never imagined I'd wind up in: leaning over a
        case of crack pipes at the local head shop, asking the proprietor if
        he'd cut me a deal on a hundred of 'em.
      </p>

      <p>
        The idea is to cover my motorcycle with crack pipes, free for the
        taking. Who'd go through the trouble of breaking off one of my dirty old
        sparkplugs when there's a hundred perfectly good crack pipes to get
        through first? Maybe the pipes would be velcroed on so that they'd be
        securely fastened yet still easily removed -- who knows? As long as I
        can keep the per unit cost down, it seems to me I'd be better off. Plus,
        can you imagine how awesome my bike would look covered with glistening
        glass? Seriously, would it not be the coolest bike in the Lower Haight?
      </p>

      <p>
        So, I don't know much about crack pipes, but I have a feeling the guy at
        the <em>Twighlight Zone Smoke Shop</em> wasn't offering me a smashing
        deal. Anyone know where I can get a good price on crack pipes in bulk?

      <h1>Brand New Colony</h1>

      <h2>11 August 2005</h2>

      <p>
        People generally don't pay enough attention to song lyrics, I've
        decided. Why that is, I don't understand. I mean, really, just read
        these lyrics from <em>Brand New Colony</em> by
        <a
          href="http://www.mp3.com/the-postal-service/artists/507880/summary.html"
          title="The Postal Service MP3, Songs and Albums"
          >The Postal Service</a
        >. Go on, read them:
      </p>

      <p>
        I'll be the grapes fermented, bottled and<br />
        served with the table set in my finest suit<br />
        like a perfect gentleman.<br />
        I'll be the fire escape that's bolted to the<br />
        ancient brick where you will sit<br />
        and contemplate your day.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'll be the waterwings that save you if you<br />
        start drowning in an open tab when your<br />
        judgment's on the brink.<br />
        I'll be the phonograph that plays your favorite<br />
        albums back as you're lying there, drifting off<br />
        to sleep... Drifting off to sleep...<br />
        I'll be the platform shoes; undo what heredity's done to you:<br />
        you won't have to strain to look into my eyes.<br />
        I'll be your winter coat, buttoned and zipped<br />
        straight to the throat with the collar up so<br />
        you won't catch a cold.
      </p>

      <p>
        I want to take you far from the cynics in this town<br />
        and kiss you on the mouth.<br />
        We'll cut our bodies free from the tethers of<br />
        this scene, start a brand new colony.<br />
        Where everything will change, we'll give<br />
        ourselves new names. Identities erased.<br />
        The sun will heat the grounds, under our bare<br />
        feet in this brand new colony.<br />
        Brand new colony...
      </p>

      <p>
        Everything will change.<br />
        Everything will change.<br />
        Everything will change.
      </p>

      <p>Considering recent events, my theme song today:</p>

        Her name is Yoshimi<br />
        she's a black belt in karate<br />
        working for the city<br />
        she has to discipline her body
      </p>

      <p>
        'Cause she knows that<br />
        it's demanding<br />
        to defeat those evil machines<br />
        I know she can beat them
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh Yoshimi, they don't believe me<br />
        but you won't let those robots eat me<br />

      <p>
        Those evil-natured robots<br />
        they're programmed to destroy us<br />
        she's gotta be strong to fight them<br />
        so she's taking lots of vitamins
      </p>

      <p>
        'Cause she knows that<br />
        it'd be tragic<br />
        if those evil robots win<br />
        I know she can beat them
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh Yoshimi, they don't believe me<br />
        but you won't let those robots defeat me<br />

      <h1>Come as you are</h1>

      <h2>10 February 2005</h2>

      <p>
        I hear my upstairs neighbor perform Nirvana's "Come As You Are" on a
        cello about once a month.
      </p>

      <p>I <em>love</em> living in the city.</p>

      <h1>Beck's forthcoming album</h1>

      <h2>2 February 2005</h2>

      <p>
        I don't claim to have an exclusive on this by a long shot, but I
        recently got my hands on a leaked copy of Beck's forthcoming album,
        which is reportedly scheduled to be released officially on March 29 --
        but may now be released earlier to minimize the damage of an internet
        leak.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm telling you: get a copy of this, and then give it a chance or two or
        three. I don't know if it's just a weird mood I'm in these days, but I'm
        really, really liking this album the more I listen to it. It's classic
        Beck plus, well, I don't know what. It sounds new and familiar at the
        same time.
      </p>

      <h1>The Golden Gate</h1>

      <h2>1 February 2005</h2>

      <p>
        I recently rode my bicycle across the Golden Gate Bridge for the first
        time in a while. (I've been busy; I've been preoccupied.) Amazingly, I
        had almost forgotten how stunningly beautiful some of the views offered
        by that experience can be. Wow! You really have to just go try it out
        for yourself, even if it has to be on one of those

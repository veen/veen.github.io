      <h1>Finally</h1>

      <h2>23 December 2002</h2>

      <p>
        Finally, a company whose business practices don't make me immediately
        cringe. I recently ordered a messenger bag from
        <a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/">Timbuk2 Designs</a>, using their
        online
        <a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/byob/byob.html">Build Your Own Bag</a>
        tool. When I opened the package they shipped me a few days later, I
        found, along with my bag, a letter that began like this:
      </p>

      <p>--</p>

      <p>New Timbuk2 Bag Owner,</p>

      <p>
        Congratulations on your new purchase -- designed by you, built by us. No
        off-shore production, no sweat-shops, nothing but quality workmanship
        from the heart of downtown San Francisco. We stand behind our products
        100% -- so if our bag falls apart (yeah, right!), if it fails to meet
        your most critical expectations, of if we just happened to screw up your
        order, go to www.timbuk2.com, click on the Customer Service page and
        follow the instructions for returning a bag.
      </p>

      <p>--</p>

      <p>
        That sounds good to me -- especially in a time when many companies
        profit by exploitation and therefore want me to remain ignorant of how
        they supply the products and services they sell. That sounds good to me
        in a time when many companies shirk responsibility and make me take all
        the risks and send me through labrynthine voice mail systems when I have
        a problem.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sure, Timbuk2 isn't blameless. (For example, my bag is made of Cordura,
        a material manufactured solely by DuPont -- which isn't exactly a model
        for socially responsible bussinesses). But there is, at least, a tone of
        integrity, responsibility, and respect in their letter to me. And I
        appreciate that.

      <h1>Emerging visual literacies</h1>

        My <a href="http://www.veen.com/veen/greg/seeing/">essay</a> on the
        visual literacies that are emerging in today's newest communications
        media is back online. (It was temporarily unavailable while I took care
        of a few technical issues that came up when it moved to a new host.)

      <h1>Tree-sitter goes online</h1>

      <h2>13 December 2002</h2>

      <p>
        Just when you might have thought all things Internet-related had been
        co-opted by the profit-centric corporate ethic, a tree-sitter in the
        Headwaters Forest of Northern California gets a wireless-enabled laptop
        from a group of San Francisco
        <a href="http://sf.indymedia.org">Independent Media Center</a>
        activists and starts sending you
        <a href="http://www.contrast.org/treesit/">dispatches</a> from
        (literally) the front lines of the battle to save old growth forests.

      <h1>Who makes your clothes?</h1>

      <h2>3 December 2002</h2>

      <p>
        <i>I asked <a href="http://www.patagonia.com">Patagonia</a>:</i>
      </p>

      <p>Hello Patagonia,</p>

      <p>
        I am curious about where your products are manufactured -- and, more
        importantly, under what conditions. Can you provide any information
        about this?
      </p>

      <p>Thank you very much for your time.</p>

      <p>Greg</p>

      <p><i>Patagonia responded:</i></p>

      <p>Hi Greg,</p>

      <p>
        Thanks for your email. We manufacture goods in China, Malaysia, Turkey,
        the UK, the USA and other countries. In addition, garments assembled
        both in and out of the US may contain parts manufactured both in and out
        of the USA. On our website, www.patagonia.com, we note which products
        are made in the USA under the "Details" tab on the product page.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for working conditions, Patagonia is a founding member of the Fair
        Labor Association (F.L.A.), originally known as the Apparel Industry
        Partnership. President Clinton convened this group in 1997 to address
        the issues you raise in your correspondence. Our Code of Conduct, a copy
        of which is provided here, is that of the F.L.A.
      </p>

      <p>
        On a more personal note, Patagonia's production team believes Patagonia
        products belong only in facilities that any Patagonia employee or
        customer would find acceptable upon a personal visit. The Production
        staff, in the course of its work, travels to every production location
        to manage the more traditional agenda of our business: quality, delivery
        schedules and cost negotiations. Through this process, we have found
        that only suppliers who treat their employees as valuable assets can
        consistently achieve the results we demand in these areas. There is a
        linkage between the two agendas that make it very easy for us to embrace
        both. In fact, we have come to view them as inseparable.
      </p>

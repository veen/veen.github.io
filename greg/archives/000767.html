      <h1>Crack pipes</h1>

      <h2>16 August 2005</h2>

      <p>
        I own a 1972 Honda CB500/4 motorbike, and I park it on the street in my
        wonderful neighborhood, the
        <a
          href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=94117&ll=37.771851,-122.433422&spn=0.003698,0.007135&t=h&hl=en"
          >Lower Haight district of San Francisco</a
        >. The problem? The bike's sparkplugs keep disappearing. I'm told that
        urban crack addicts are notorious for breaking off the top piece of
        exposed sparkplugs (like mine) because, in a pinch, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkplug#Insulator"
          >ceramic part</a
        >
        makes a decent crack pipe.
      </p>

      <p>
        I recently lost two sparkplugs to the crackheads in under a week, so I
        really started thinking hard about how to put an end to this nonsense. I
        mean, come on, I've had my bike <em>towed</em> because a missing
        sparkplug kept me from moving it. And even though I now keep a stock of
        replacements on board to prevent that from ever happening again, new
        plugs aren't exactly a dime a dozen nowadays. This is not an inexpensive
        problem to have.
      </p>

      <p>
        In thinking about this, I realized that short of garaging the bike,
        really the only way to solve my problem would be to provide a more
        appealing (and cheaper!) alternative to smoking crack through a spark
        plug. And that's how I found myself in a very strange position -- one
        that, quite frankly, I never imagined I'd wind up in: leaning over a
        case of crack pipes at the local head shop, asking the proprietor if
        he'd cut me a deal on a hundred of 'em.
      </p>

      <p>
        The idea is to cover my motorcycle with crack pipes, free for the
        taking. Who'd go through the trouble of breaking off one of my dirty old
        sparkplugs when there's a hundred perfectly good crack pipes to get
        through first? Maybe the pipes would be velcroed on so that they'd be
        securely fastened yet still easily removed -- who knows? As long as I
        can keep the per unit cost down, it seems to me I'd be better off. Plus,
        can you imagine how awesome my bike would look covered with glistening
        glass? Seriously, would it not be the coolest bike in the Lower Haight?
      </p>

      <p>
        So, I don't know much about crack pipes, but I have a feeling the guy at
        the <em>Twighlight Zone Smoke Shop</em> wasn't offering me a smashing
        deal. Anyone know where I can get a good price on crack pipes in bulk?

            I'm not a bike expert. But why dont you just take out your spark
            plugs when you park the bike for the night? A bit of a hastle I
            imagine but at least it wont encourge the druggies.

            I dunno Jeff, if I was a crackhead, I'd take the crack pipe and your
            spark plug. Just in case there's a shortage of usuable materials in
            the future. My vote for garaging the bike.

            And, yeah, you can take out the outermost (#s 1 and 4) plugs, but
            then you have to carry a wrench with you and who knows what kind of
            garbage will get in the holes. I generally park my bike under a
            streetlight and it's been mostly fine (maybe 3 plugs "piped" in the
            last 8 years), but you could also get a lockable bike cover. Since
            it's an access issue, making it just hard enough to get the
            crackhead to go to some OTHER bike will keep yours safe-ish. Or just
            go on Ebay, get a case of plugs for $20 and keep a wrench a around.

            I admit, I am not the most knowledgeable person when it come to
            sparkplugs, but would there possibly be a variety that would be
            unappealing to crackheads? Something without an easy to break off
            top part, or lacking ceramic crackpipe-like part? you could switch
            to those, and after a while, they might learn that you don't have
            good sparkplugs to steal.

            Damn dude. I'm sorry to hear about your plight, really, but I have
            to tell you that I haven't laughed that hard in a while. The image
            of you cruzin' on your '72 Honda CBR with 200 crackpipes hanging
            from it simply cracks me up. Personally, I'd go with the rat poison
            idea. A couple of gravely ill crackheads lying around your bike
            ought to send the message through the community that your particular
            bike should be left alone. Oh man, that's nice, pure,
            uncompassionate comedy.

            That's the best laugh I've had in a while. I like the ambush the
            crackhead approach. Maybe something a little less lethal than rat
            poison, but enough to leave them moaning next to your bike on the
            street for several hours to ward off the other crackheads. That
            craigslist rant was HILARIOUS. Alternatively, we could tie Bella up
            to your bike overnight so she can guard it for you. :P

            The solution to your problem seemed very logical immediately after
            reading your first paragraph. MOVE! Don't live amongst sparkplug
            stealing crackheads!

            Dude why not just try and get a deal on defective sparkplugs at bike
            shops throughout the bay area, coat them in rat poison and just keep
            them in a pouch on your bike?
          </p>

          <p>
            That way the mechanics get rid of a bunch of broken crap they don't
            need, the crackheads get to experience the thrill of stealing to
            maintain their disgusting habit without risking that annoying loss
            of flesh while trying to remove a sparkplug with trembling hands and
            YOU actually get to start your bike in the morning with the peace of
            mind that comes with knowing that some unknown crackhead a few
            blocks from your bike has probably fallen over dead and will not be
            fucking with your shit anymore.

            they sell little glass tubes with a fake flower in them in convience
            stores. you could probally get a good deal on a box of them on ebay.
            dont forget to strap on some steel wool scouwering pads too. they
            will need them along with the glass tubes. i hope i helped. ~matt

            I wouldn't put the pipes all over the bike, instead I would somehow
            place it near the plug so when the crack head searches for the plug
            to break he finds a pipe. Also, I guarantee you it is like leaving a
            bowl of halloween candy out, the first one is going to take all...
            Except you have a better chance with the halloween candy and zero
            chance with a crack head. Another option, maybe place a sticker you
            print off a computer, yeah to us it may look homemade but a crack
            head will never know as they sold their TV for crack and never have
            even seen a computer unless it was from your house and sold that
            night... Anyway, make the sticker saying, Caution - Spark Plugs
            coated with Toxic paint, do not inhale or store in non ventalated
            areas... I think it would work, either that or they may take them
            faster hoping it will get them higher, considering crack is made
            with amonia... Or they will steal it for someone else that was
            paying 1.00 for them to get a pipe and that is what they get... Oh
            as for the steel whool, it is Chore Boy or copper scrub, oh yeah,
            don't piss them off by removing it or somthing that is obvious to be
            for the reason of deturing a crack head as I am sure a single bike
            tipping will cost alot more than several of the spark plugs... Okay,
            good luck, I am sure most of this is in good humor, but if you
            actually continue through with any of it, I want a picture!
            jonburke@aol.com.. Also, results!!! Good Luck!

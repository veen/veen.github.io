      <h1>Measure Map acquired by Google</h1>

      <h2>14 February 2006</h2>

      <p>
        It's official:
        <a
          href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/02/here-comes-measure-map.html"
          >Google has acquired Measure Map</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        I won't say too much more now, except for this: I've had an amazing time
        (with an amazing team) designing and developing this product over the
        past year, and I'm incredibly excited for what's in store next. Here we
        go!

            And yet you still think it's acceptable to just eat the entire
            apple, core, seeds, stem and all.

            not <em>crazy</em>.

            Greg! don't tell me you've taken over Dad's "eat-the-entire-apple"?
            He doesn't eat the stem either..if this is true, it's genetics!!!

            You are only scum because I didn't even know you were working on
            anything, let alone a project picked up by Google. Incidentally, a
            company that helps, along with yahoo!, to keep the people of China
            completely in the dark about world politics. Anyway, what'sup? When
            you visiting the other side of the pond?<br />

            I can't eat the entire apple <i>BECAUSE</i> our father did. (you
            know, the whole tree growing in your stomach thing!)
          </p>

          <p>Anyway, Congrats to my two brothers...</p>

            What's wrong with eating the whole apple As long as the core looks
            good.Maybe that is what we all did back in the old country where
            your Dad and I come from.

      <h1>Fat Free Water</h1>

      <h2>15 October 2005</h2>

      <p>
        Late one Friday evening a few weeks ago, some friends and I stopped at a
        Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf store downtown. When I bought a bottle of
        water to wash down my double espresso, I noticed something peculiar:
        this wasn't just <em>ordinary</em> water -- this was

          >Fat Free Water</a
        >. I couldn't believe it. I mean, it's one thing to put a "fat free"
        label on, say, a bag of

        <em>water</em>? After we

          >took photos</a
        >
        to document it, we thought it would be funny to call up the toll free
        information line mentioned on the bottle and ask about their fat
        extraction process. So I did.
      </p>

      <p>
        A labrynthine automated telephone customer service system eventually
        sent me to voice mail, it being after business hours and all. I left a
        message explaining that I'd just bought a bottle of fat free water and
        was curious about how it's made. "How exactly do you extract the fat
        from the water?" I asked. I left my name and number, hung up, chuckled,
        and promptly pretty much forgot about the whole thing.
      </p>

      <p>
        But then a couple of days ago I got a call from an area code I didn't
        recognize, and, wouldn't you know it, it was a customer service
        representative from The Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf, responding to my
        inquiry about the fat extraction process used to produce Fat Free Water.
        I almost couldn't keep it together while listening to this woman explain
        that they don't <em>actually</em> remove any fat from the water since,
        in fact, water is naturally fat free. The "Fat Free" label on the
        bottle, she said, is just a kitchsy marketing tactic.
      </p>

      <p>No! <em>Really?</em></p>

      <p>
        Wow. This is marketing at its worst. Not only are they presenting a
        product deceptively, they're also bold enough to claim that it's just a
        joke! Come on, guys. You're not being ironic. You just want to sell a
        bunch of water to the ignorant and body-image-crazed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Still, the whole thing is pretty hilarious. Well, at least to me: "Laugh
        all you like," says some guy in

        >, "but since I switched to fat-free water the weight has just slipped
        right off."

            Hmmm. Our brains are 60% fat, so this isn't exactly brain food, eh?
            Makes you wonder what's inside the Smart Water though.

            I don't mind that type of pitch when it's done more authentically.
            Something like, "Fat free, as always" isn't bad for say, salsa.
            However, it still seems over the top to use the term on water.
          </p>

          <p>
            It would be funny if they covered the bottle with every "_____ free"
            feature of water. That could be both authentic, and a fun marketing
            angle.

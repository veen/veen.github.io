      <h1>Fat Free Water</h1>

      <h2>15 October 2005</h2>

      <p>
        Late one Friday evening a few weeks ago, some friends and I stopped at a
        Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf store downtown. When I bought a bottle of
        water to wash down my double espresso, I noticed something peculiar:
        this wasn't just <em>ordinary</em> water -- this was

          >Fat Free Water</a
        >. I couldn't believe it. I mean, it's one thing to put a "fat free"
        label on, say, a bag of

        <em>water</em>? After we

        >
        to document it, we thought it would be funny to call up the toll free
        information line mentioned on the bottle and ask about their fat
        extraction process. So I did.
      </p>

      <p>
        A labrynthine automated telephone customer service system eventually
        sent me to voice mail, it being after business hours and all. I left a
        message explaining that I'd just bought a bottle of fat free water and
        was curious about how it's made. "How exactly do you extract the fat
        from the water?" I asked. I left my name and number, hung up, chuckled,
        and promptly pretty much forgot about the whole thing.
      </p>

      <p>
        But then a couple of days ago I got a call from an area code I didn't
        recognize, and, wouldn't you know it, it was a customer service
        representative from The Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf, responding to my
        inquiry about the fat extraction process used to produce Fat Free Water.
        I almost couldn't keep it together while listening to this woman explain
        that they don't <em>actually</em> remove any fat from the water since,
        in fact, water is naturally fat free. The "Fat Free" label on the
        bottle, she said, is just a kitchsy marketing tactic.
      </p>

      <p>No! <em>Really?</em></p>

      <p>
        Wow. This is marketing at its worst. Not only are they presenting a
        product deceptively, they're also bold enough to claim that it's just a
        joke! Come on, guys. You're not being ironic. You just want to sell a
        bunch of water to the ignorant and body-image-crazed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Still, the whole thing is pretty hilarious. Well, at least to me: "Laugh
        all you like," says some guy in

        right off."

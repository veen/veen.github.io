      <h1>It's easy, it's fair and it's legal?</h1>

      <h2>28 April 2003</h2>

      <p>
        Apple has released a new version of its iTunes music player and cd
        burning software, which now includes an integrated "Music Store" where
        users can buy and download songs for 99 cents each. Now, of course I'm
        interested whenever new developments threaten to change how we make,
        promote, distribute and consume music. But I approach such developments
        cautiously when big record companies are involved, as they are in this
        case. I've been disappointed again and again by how groups like the RIAA
        (as well as certain [formerly?-]big-name-stars, like Metallica) blindly
        cling to outmoded notions of authorship and intellectual property as
        they assert what seem to me to be almost embarrassingly self-serving
        agendas -- such as, for example, when they've fought to control and/or
        monetize peer to peer file sharing over the internet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Which is why I hesitate to openly accept Apple's claim that buying and
        downloading music through their Music Store is "fair." How are the
        record companies involved, exactly? And the artists? In
        <a href="http://www.apple.com/music/store/">apple.com's words</a>, "The
        iTunes Music Store is fast and convenient for you, and fair to the
        artists and record companies. In a nutshell, you can play your music on
        up to three computers, enjoy unlimited synching with your iPods, burn
        unlimited CDs of individual songs, and burn unchanged playlists up to 10
        times each."
      </p>

      <p>
        So. 99 cents per song, plus some strings attached ("<i
          >up to three computers</i
        >", "<i>up to 10 times each</i>"). Where does each cent go? What's
        Apple's share, I wonder? And can new, unsigned artists sell music at the
        Music Store, by-passing the record companies? So many questions...

        Frigid evenings on Alcatraz. That's one powerful view of the City
        through prison bars.

        Fast nights in North Beach, Chinatown. Where better to go for books and
        poetry and cityscapes and quite-clearly-insane Buddha bartenders?

        Boogaloo breakfast in the heart of the Mission. 11am hungover hipsters.

      <h1>We're neighbors</h1>

      <p>
        My computer's wireless network card tells me it finds the following
        wireless networks within range of itself:
      </p>

      <p>
        alaska<br />
        cantina<br />
        lynksis<br />
        963 Page International
      </p>

      <p>
        Just a few weeks ago, it was just alaska and cantina. Interesting. I may
        soon know more neighboring computers than neighboring people.

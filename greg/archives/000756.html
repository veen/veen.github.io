      <h2>20 July 2005</h2>

      <p>
        A friend of a friend reports: a couple of nights ago the mariachi-style
        guitarist/singer one commonly sees at the

        Apparently, Beck wasn't widely recognized. That, or people were more
        interested in their burritos than in some rock star's free impromptu
        acoustic set.
      </p>

      <p>
        Me? I totally would've been there if I'd known about it. I think Pancho
        Villa should start a concert series. Would be very good for burrito
        sales, I suspect.

            That is quite possibly the coolest thing I have heard this week. Go
            Beck! I wonder if he got any tips?

            I wonder if we can get him to play at the Tento!!! Silverlake isn't
            that far away. I can see it now:

          <p>"Two fish tacos and a microphone!"</p>

          <p>And we could get sodas from the 7-11 down the street!!! YES!!!</p>

          <p>Or maybe not.</p>

            I offer my humblest apologies. That WAS in fact Beck. I'm a big fan
            of his and when I saw the water cooler behind him, I refused to
            believe it. It's hard to believe, but it's true. Coolest thing I
            ever heard.

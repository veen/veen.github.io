      <h1>RIAA radar</h1>

      <h2>20 May 2003</h2>

      <p>
        "The <a href="http://www.magnetbox.com/riaa/">RIAA Radar</a> is a tool
        that music consumers can use to easily and instantly distinguish whether
        an album was released by a member of the Recording Industry Association
        of America. [...]
      </p>

      <p>
        Why should I use it?<br />
        Just as people can currently find out where some products come from and
        who made them (Is this banana organic? Does this milk contain GMOs? Were
        these clothes made in a sweatshop?), it is important to have that
        knowledge for as many consumer goods as possible. Knowledge is power,
        and knowing where the product came from can (and should) influence what
        you buy. [...]
      </p>

      <p>
        Why is it important to know if an album was released by an RIAA member
        or not?<br />
        That's possibly a fairly long answer, but just the highlights of the
        RIAA's practices involve price-fixing, blaming its poor financial state
        on unfounded digital piracy claims (and in turn, blaming its own
        consumers), lobbying for changes that hinder technological innovation
        and change copyright laws, underpaying the artists it represents,
        invading personal privacy to enforce copyrights, and dismantling entire
        computer networks just because of their ability (of their users) to
        share copyrighted files."

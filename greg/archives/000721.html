      <h1>Johnny Greenwood, duplicate</h1>

      <h2>5 May 2005</h2>

      <p>
        Is it just me, or does Russell Lissack, guitarist for
        <a href="http://www.blocparty.com/" title="Bloc Party">Bloc Party</a>,
        bear a striking resemblance to
        <a href="http://www.radiohead.com/" title="Radiohead">Radiohead</a>'s
        evil-genius-mad-scientist guitarist/noisist Johnny Greenwood? Here's
        Greenwood on the left, Lissack on the right:

      </p>

      <p>
        I don't have video to point to, but, wow, Lissack even
        <em>moves</em> like Greenwood.
      </p>

      <p>They're both great guitarists as well, of course.</p>

            WOW! That's nuts. This Russell Lissack has a sweatband on his right
            wrist. Is he attempting to copy Johnny's wrist/forearm splint too?
            He's got the guitar, the hair, and the waaaaay too skinny stature to
            match.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now if he can play like Johnny (one of my top 3 guitarists) then I
            guess his copy-cat look is ok with me. If he can't talk the talk,
            then he's a poser wanna-be.
          </p>

          <p>
            Which I can't knock either cuz I wanna be Johnny too -- but I'm just
            short, fat, have short hair and only know about 20 guitar chords :)

            person. This requires further research.

            johhny has a big jawbone tho and his face is rather square, where as
            russell has quite a thin face, but yeah i spose they do, russell is
            a good guitarist too

            Russell aint gay people there are many pics around of him with his
            girlfriend or ex girlfriend.<br />
            Russell loves Radiohead so there may be some idolisation with
            Johnny. I must admit they do look similiar in those pics. I don't
            think Johnny has a Blochead though (Russells famous asymmetrical
            haircut).<br />
            Go and see Bloc Party live though seen em twice and they rock
            especially the fanclub gig. Russell does have the moves too
            hahaha<br />

            the only reason people assume members from bloc party are gay is
            because Kele once rightly said to an interviewer: "i wont answer
            that" when the interviewer asked him. He is only doing this to state
            a point; that he will not become a celebrity and dosent the press or
            others into his private life and lets his music do the talking.

            Radiohead was one of russell's influences... and greenwood is
            someone russell just idolises, i have to say myself i have the same
            problem with russell, i have copied his guitar choice, wristband and
            soon to be hair =P

            Ok, Bloc Party and RADIOHEAD are probably my two favorite bands,
            along with Death Cab and the Postal Service. Both bands and both
            guitarists are great. Johnny Greenwood has been my hero since i was
            eleven (im fourteen now), and plain and simple he is a better
            guitarist but not from years of experience, he was a protege'. He
            started out in the RADOIHEAD (then called "on a friday" because they
            practiced on fridays) playing harmonica, and that was just cause his
            brother was the bassist and wouldnt leave them alone, he learned
            piano and they let him play keyboard, then he started guitar lessons
            and was incredible. All of the members of RADIOHEAD are musical
            geniouses(dammmn i suck at spelling). But anyway of course Lissack
            is copying Johnny and i doubt he denys it. The blco haircut though,
            Johnny had it first, but it's the standard indie-kid haircut i have
            one just like it (little shorter in the front and longer in the back
            than Johnny and Russell's but still recognizable). Thats how i look
            when i play with my band, imitation is the highest form of flattery,
            but the guitar isnt because he's imitating Johnny the Tele is the
            standard indie guitar the world over, Thom Yorke uses a couple
            Teles, Snow Patrol, Nada Surf, The Wallflowers, etc. It just has the
            perfect tone for indie. THe Vox AC-30 is the standard indie amp
            Radiohead, The Wallflowers, Nada Surf (I think), etc. (Though Bloc
            Party use Fenders and Snow PAtrol use Marshalls, I personally play a
            Danelectro slim-line through a Fender Hot Rod Deluxe, though I want
            a Tele) As to the comment that Johnny's guitar is nicer, thats not
            really true, it's just different he uses a Tele Plus which just has
            a humbucker at lead to thicken the sound. And whoever maddie is, my
            email address is indiekid789@gmail.com can you have Russel email me
            I'd like to talk to to him about guitar technique and equipment, and
            exactly how he gets his sound right.

            I think Russell is lovely! I don't think he copies Johnny's style.
            Plenty people look like others. It's just a coincidence.<br />
            About the Russell being gay thing: I don't know. He's fit! But he is
            strangely feminine. I've never heard him talk. Anyone know a link
            where he's talking? Cus then I can tell if he's gay or not. But I
            don't really care, cuz he's a kick-ass guitarist and Bloc Party is
            my fave band :)

            I have been friends with russell for about 10 years and I can tell
            you for 100% fact that he's not gay. Last night we both went to see
            Radiohead in Hammermith coz we've loved them since we were kids.
            Russell doesnt idolise Jonny, but admires him, as we all do. Russell
            has learned various tricks from Jonny, but he's also come up with a
            unique sound of his own. Why bother comparing who's 'better'? Let's
            just enjoy both their work

            FFS what is with everyone mispelling Jonny's name? THERE ARE NO H'S.

            btw yeah that is really freaky that they are so similar. Separated
            at birth?

            What the fuck, Russell is not gay. Just because he doesn't have big
            hairy arms and grunt doesn't mean he's not straight.
          </p>

          <p>Plus there are photos of him with his girlfriend.</p>

          <p>So shut the fuck up. And Bloc Party is awesome.</p>

            He is unsure of his sexuality. I know him really. He told me. He had
            a gurlfriend mates. Anyway he's very sweet and he's
            Hottt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He's a dream boat and when he hugs you or
            kiss you you would faint. I did. We email each other non stop some
            of the time when he gets to and he's even sweet on email!<br />

            All I have to say is that I love Johnny Greenwood. I played guitar
            for 4 years kinda trundling along, doing grades, not disliking it,
            but not enjoying it. Got to grade four and realised that I was so
            restricted in my playing, just with grade pieces. So with Radiohead
            being my favourite band, I decided to learn two songs, Paranoid
            Android and My Iron Lung. After getting those down I flourished,
            joined a band, got better, left band and now I'm in Aura. Check us
            out at

            P.S. Don't know much bout that Lissack guy, but if he likes Johnny,
            he can't be bad! :P

        -- for one, Ben Bridwell's voice sounds an awful lot like James Mercer's
        -- and, frankly, the similarities between the two bands was reason
        enough for me to take an almost automatic (though still tentative)
        liking to them early on. But as I've settled in to this record, that
        comparison has receeded into the background, and I've realized how great
        some of these songs really are.

        "The Funeral" is one of the best of the songs. It's got this great line,
        belted out over and over: "At every occasion, I'll be ready for a
        funeral." Amazingly, this doesn't come across as corny; in fact, it's
        incredible and powerful and -- I want to be careful to not be corny here
        myself, but -- almost majestic. <em>Majesty</em>: it's the word the

          >Pitchfork review</a

        uses, which puts it better than I can: "Turning despondency into indie
        majesty is a major talent of Band of Horses; their music is carefully
        balanced to evoke specific emotional responses while allowing space for
        personal projection."

        Ok, so I think all this talk <em>has</em> gotten a little corny. Just go
        listen to this great record. And listen closely.

            Oh man. I love that band. Someone sent me a song of theirs and I've
            started hunting them down on the web. I've been meaning to post my
            own review. Definitely one of the best new bands I've run into in a
            while.

            I keep running into this site searching for different band lyrics -
            weird<br />
            But what a great band. Yes shin-quality but their sound reminded me
            more my of My Morning Jackets latest "Z"... Anyways I really enjoy
            "Our Sords" but the whole CD is great....

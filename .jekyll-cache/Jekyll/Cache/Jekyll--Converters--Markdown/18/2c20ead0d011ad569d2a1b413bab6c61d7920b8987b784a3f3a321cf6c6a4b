I"	<p>Iâ€™ve spent the last week inside a massive financial services corporation doing some content inventory and architecture consulting. As we spoke to the various departments within the organization, I kept a section of my notes as a glossary, recording and defining the jargon I encountered. Hereâ€™s a list of the more interesting onesâ€¦</p>

<p><strong>Big Bang</strong> <em>v.</em> A major launch event. â€œThe new home page will be big banged in Q3.â€</p>

<p><strong>Boil the Ocean</strong> <em>v.</em> Try to solve too many problems with an overambitious project, typically resulting in a complete failure. Many Content Management projects end up this way when attempting to port an entire organizationâ€™s content, process, and workflow into one new, massive tool. â€œLook, just help the HR teams get their forms online. We donâ€™t need to boil the ocean with this.â€</p>

<p><strong>Buddha Nature</strong> <em>n.</em> The One True Home of a page or resource in a Web siteâ€™s structure. There may be multiple pathways for arriving at it, but it only lives in one spot. â€œYou can get to your account statement from any banking page, but itâ€™s Buddha Nature is the Document Center.â€</p>

<p><strong>Deep Diving</strong> <em>v.</em>  Giving users the ability to bookmark a page deep within the site. â€œWeâ€™ve enabled deep diving in the employee directory by changing the URL structure.â€</p>

<p><strong>Framejack</strong> <em>v.</em> to move a user horizontally through an architecture, switching the interface to another vertical, in the context of a single task. â€œIf a user clicks on My Account while in the Checking vertical, they get framejacked to the Document Center.â€</p>

<p><strong>SME</strong> <em>n.</em> Acronym for â€œSubject Matter Expertâ€. Pronounced â€œsmeeâ€. These are domain experts, typically in specific business unit of an organization. â€œWeâ€™ll need to talk to a few SMEs before changing the architecture of this section of the site.â€</p>

<p><strong>SUAC</strong> <em>v.</em> Acronym for â€œShut Up and Colorâ€. How Marketing and Engineering departments often think (or wish) design should be done.</p>

<p><strong>S2BU</strong> <em>n.</em> Acronym for â€œSucks To Be Youâ€. A page with an error message that communicates to the user that they are not authorized to continue an interaction. â€œIf they arenâ€™t retired or over 55, they get an S2BU and we point them to the home page.â€</p>

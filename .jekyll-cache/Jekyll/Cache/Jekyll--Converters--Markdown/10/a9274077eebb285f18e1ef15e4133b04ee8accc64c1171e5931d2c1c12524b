I"	<p>It was nearly six years ago, in a bar in the Mission district of San Francisco. I was having a drink with friends and we were talking about baseball - home runs, in fact. It felt like just about anyone could put one over the fence - Sosa, McGuire, and Bonds were competing for single-season records and someone even suggested that Hank Aaron’s all-time mark could fall.</p>

<p>Mike Monteiro, one of the founders of <a href="http://muledesign.com/">Mule Design</a>, was there that night. “Bonds will do it,” he said. “I have no doubt in my mind.”</p>

<p>“Bonds?” I said. “You’ve got to be kidding. He’s old, injured, and taking so much junk - he won’t even last the next season.”</p>

<p>“You have no faith.”</p>

<p>“You’re blinded by hero worship.”</p>

<p>And on it went. Eventually, we found ourselves at an impasse. And, as guys do when they argue about sports, we decided to make it interesting.</p>

<p>“Alright. A hundred dollars says he does it,” Mike said.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so minor league. Five hundred,” I countered.</p>

<p>“Oh yeah? Loser buys a luxury box at a game.”</p>

<p>I paused. Clearly, this wasn’t about money. It was about pride. I had to go after his. “We have to make this count. This has to be something really meaningful.”</p>

<p>“What do you have in mind?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Loser wears a dress to a game.”</p>

<p>We shook hands.</p>

<p>Last night, Bonds put one into the centerfield bleachers. There were fireworks, speeches, and tributes. My IM client popped up a few minutes later with a message from Mike:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>See you at the game…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am a man of my word. Later this season, I will uphold my end of the wager. There is already talk of reserving the centerfield bleachers and getting a little something up on the Jumbotron. I’m considering my wardrobe; elegant and tasteful while still fun and flattering. Your suggestions would be most appreciated in the comments.</p>

<p>My only consolation? I’ll be a 6’6” guy with a goatee wearing a dress in San Francisco. Nobody will blink an eye…</p>

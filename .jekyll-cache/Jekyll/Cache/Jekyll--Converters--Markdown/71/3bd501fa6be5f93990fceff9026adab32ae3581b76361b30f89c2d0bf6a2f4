I"™	<p>One of the nice things about organizing your <a href="http://thestartconference.com/">own conference</a> is getting to choose who you want on stage. Thatâ€™s been particularly fun these last couple weeks as Bryan and I have been thinking about who weâ€™d like to talk to and what weâ€™d like them to tell us.</p>

<p>We started with some good friends whom weâ€™ve worked with and respect. <a href="http://evhead.blogspot.com/">Ev Williams</a>, for example, was an easy choice. Weâ€™ve known him forever, and worked on a redesign of <a href="http://blogger.com">Blogger</a> together a few years ago. Weâ€™re talking to him about how his new thing, <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, is growing and evolving, what the challenges and opportunities are, and the lessons heâ€™s learned so far. Iâ€™ve had similar conversations recently with both <a href="http://ma.tt/">Matt Mullengweg</a> of <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> and <a href="http://www.dollarshort.org/">Mena Trott</a> of <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">6apart</a>. Their stories have interesting parallels, but even better divergence.</p>

<p>So, yeah, a lot of our friends are in the blogging world. But we do know a few people outside of that world. <a href="http://83degrees.com/">Julie Davidson and Narendra Rocherolle</a>, for example, are joining us to talk about their unique partnership, both in business and in life. Theyâ€™ve built <a href="http://www.webshots.com/">Webshots</a>, one of the first photo sharing apps, as well as <a href="http://30boxes.com/">30boxes</a>, a fantastic calendar app that stands as a fantastic example of how to do the Right Thing when building on the web.</p>

<p>On the other end of the entrepreneurial spectrum is our pal <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/">Merlin Mann</a>. Heâ€™s built a solid brand out of his productivity site <a href="http://43folders.com/">43Folders</a> and weâ€™re looking forward to talking to him about how he did that. But also, Iâ€™m particularly interested in his ideas for how small teams can find the best ways to work together and communicate with each other. Also, he is a bit, um, energetic on stage. We should have a good time.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve got a bunch more people joining us on stage - people who follow the industry, comment on it, invest in it, and help companies get started. Iâ€™ll post more on them soon. I hope you can <a href="http://thestartconference.com/">join us</a>.

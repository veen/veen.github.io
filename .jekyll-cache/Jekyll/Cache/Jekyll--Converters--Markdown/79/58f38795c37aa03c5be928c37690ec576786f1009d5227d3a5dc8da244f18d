I"Â<p>Over the past year, I‚Äôve evaluated the search experiences on a number of popular content sites. With the help of author and interface designer Darcy DiNucci, I picked apart the search and result designs from sites like Apple.com, NASA.gov, SchwabFoundation.org, and a variety of others. We focused on content sites, rather than e-commerce or Web applications, and we avoided general Web search engines entirely.</p>

<p>Our finding, not surprisingly, is that almost every site‚Äôs search engine could use improvement. We also found that most organizations‚Äô Web teams couldn‚Äôt really affect the quality of their search results ‚Äî they were stuck tweaking search technologies that had already been purchased and installed. Often, the most dramatic change they could make was in the design of the search and results interfaces. In some cases, as the old saying goes, this was like putting lipstick on a pig. But cleaning things up does help users find answers to their queries.</p>

<p>Through our research, we discovered eight quick fixes that will improve your site‚Äôs search experience:</p>

<h2 id="1-question-search-engine-defaults">1. Question search engine defaults.</h2>

<p>Before turning on your search software, evaluate every option the software provides in terms of user needs. For example, do they really need to hide or show the result summaries? Take away as much as you can; it will simplify your results page.</p>

<h2 id="2-relevance-is-relative">2. Relevance is relative.</h2>

<p>Ranking results based on their relevance is a subjective practice at best. Every piece of search software has its own algorithm for determining which documents best match which queries. Make sure the default ranking you select matches your user needs.</p>

<h2 id="3-help-users-avoid-mistakes">3. Help users avoid mistakes.</h2>

<p>Check your search logs. One of the top queries will inevitably be an empty submission. While we‚Äôre not sure why this happens so frequently, users often accidently submit forms before filling them out. One of the simplest usability enhancements you can make to your site‚Äôs search experience is a single line of JavaScript. Make sure the search field has something in it before allowing the form to be submitted.</p>

<h2 id="4-roll-your-own-results">4. Roll your own results.</h2>

<p>Even if you can‚Äôt change your search engine‚Äôs algorithm to be more relevant for your users, don‚Äôt give up hope. Frankly, one of the best ways to improve your results is to do them by hand. Get a report of the top search queries on your site. Take the top ten and find three to five pages that satisfy those queries. Then, create a simple script to match them up on your results page. When you have time, do the next 20 most popular. Stop when you get to 50. That will likely cover the majority of your users‚Äô queries. Check the report once a month and adjust the canned results as necessary.</p>

<h2 id="5-simplify-your-page-layout">5. Simplify your page layout.</h2>

<p>Almost every search engine can be more effective with a simple layout.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Include a wide text box with the user‚Äôs search query and a submit button labeled ‚ÄúSearch again.‚Äù</li>
  <li>Use a header that displays the total number of results and a control for displaying the next 10 (preferably an arrow pointing to the right).</li>
  <li>List 10 results with ranking numbers hanging in the column.</li>
  <li>Repeat the navigation controls at the bottom of the results.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="6-offer-help-for-zero-results">6. Offer help for zero results.</h2>

<p>If a query doesn‚Äôt find any matches, display the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A text box showing the user‚Äôs query that allows them to edit it.</li>
  <li>Possible spelling alternatives, presented with the phrase, ‚ÄúDid you mean [alternative]?‚Äù</li>
  <li>A couple of other tips as a bulleted list. ‚ÄúTry a broader search term.‚Äù or ‚ÄúTry using a synonym.‚Äù</li>
  <li>Include a link to search help, a site map, and contact page.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="7-use-categories-if-youve-got-them">7. Use categories if you‚Äôve got them.</h2>

<p>If your search software offers different search categories (often called <strong>catalogs</strong> or <strong>indices</strong>), use them to organize your results in a similar structure to your site‚Äôs architecture. Then include links at the top of the results page that show how many results match each category. This will help users narrow their search to a more manageable list.</p>

<h2 id="8-advanced-search-and-help-should-be-the-same-thing">8. Advanced search and help should be the same thing.</h2>

<p>If you link to a page that offers usage instructions for the many features of your search engine, include interfaces for those features so they can be used without switching back and forth.</p>

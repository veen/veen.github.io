<p>Itâ€™s been well over a year since Google bought <a href="http://measuremap.com/">Measure Map</a> and I left <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/">Adaptive Path</a>. And wow, have we been busy. The problem is, though, that whenever someone would ask me what weâ€™ve been up to, all I could do is smile and say, â€œOh, just wait.â€</p>

<p>Well, the waiting is finally over - we can talk about what weâ€™ve been working on all this time. Today, a completely redesigned version of <a href="http://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a> is launching, bringing a lot of the simplicity and data visualization techniques we learned building Measure Map to a whole new scale. This was some of the toughest design work Iâ€™ve ever tackled, and Iâ€™m immensely impressed with well our team worked together, especially <a href="http://veen.com/greg/">Greg Veen</a>, <a href="http://www.fivesevensix.com/">Ryan Carver</a>, and <a href="http://www.custompixel.com/">Douglas Vander Molen</a>.</p>

<p>I wrote more about the redesign over on the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/05/whole-new-experience-for-google.html">Google Blog</a>, and my colleague Avinash Kaushik has written a <a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/2007/05/google-analytics-is-re-launched-do-these-five-things-first-in-v2.html">fantastic and comprehensive overview</a> on his blog.</p>

<p>On a personal note, Iâ€™ve got a much different job now that the design work on Analytics has wrapped up. I now lead a team of over 30 designers and researchers responsible for the user experience of Googleâ€™s web applications. Weâ€™re working on Gmail, Calendar, the Office-like tools, Blogger, Orkut, Picasa, Talk and a bunch more. And that means I get to dig into some of what I consider the Webâ€™s most interesting challenges and work with some of the smartest people in the industry.</p>

<p>Canâ€™t ask for much more than that, really.</p>

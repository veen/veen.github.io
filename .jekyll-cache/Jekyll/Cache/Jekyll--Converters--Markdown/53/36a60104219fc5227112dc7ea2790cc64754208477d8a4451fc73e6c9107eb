<p>Last month, we spent some time working with the Google Reader team on an new feature theyâ€™d been developing. As a hosted application, theyâ€™ve got lots of data about what people are reading and how often blogs get updated. Wouldnâ€™t it be interesting, they suggested, if you could visualize your reading behavior and see how it matched up with publisherâ€™s behavior. Since we have some experience with data visualization, we jumped at the chance to do a 20% project.</p>

<p>The result is a set of charts and graphs that attempt to help people not only understand how they interact with content, but let them act on it as well. Turns out this is a great interface for pruning away feeds that youâ€™ve either lost interest in or are no longer being updated.</p>

<p>But beyond the visualization, this serves as a good example of collecting and understanding the ambient information that flows through our digital lives. Iâ€™ve been fascinated by this for a while, but started thinking about it more last year when <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2006/11/on_wattson_and_electr/">Tom Coates posted on the topic</a>. As we move through our connected days, the thousands of tiny behaviors can be recorded and analyzed, helping us to better understand who we really are, be it through the <a href="http://last.fm">music we listen to</a>, the sites we bookmark, or <a href="http://wesabe.com/">the money we spend</a>.</p>

<p>It makes me want more! Places I go, people I meet, energy usage, calorie consumption, heart rate â€“ just imagine all the streams of data we can record and review and learn from. But for now, Iâ€™ll settle for the feeds I read.</p>

<p>For more on the feature, see <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/01/i-like-big-charts-and-i-cannot-lie.html">Mihaiâ€™s post on the Reader blog</a>.

<p>This is a 20-minute talk I gave at the <a href="http://www.web2expo.com/webexsf2009">Web2.0 Expo</a> in San Francisco a couple weeks ago. In it, I describe two trends: how we’re shifting as a culture from consumers to participants, and how technology has enabled massive amounts of data to be recorded, stored, and analyzed. Putting those things together has resulted in some fascinating innovations that echo data visualization work that’s been happening for centuries.</p>

<p>I’ve given this talk a few times now, but this particular delivery really went well. Only having 20 minutes forced me to really stay focus, and the large audience was very engaged. I’ll be giving an extended version of this talk in June at the <a href="http://uxlondon.com/">UX London conference</a>, with a deeper look at how we integrated design and research while I was at Google.

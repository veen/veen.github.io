This starter file exercises every common pattern so a new post begins with the right structure. Replace the content below as needed.

## Section Heading

Use H2 for major sections. Keep paragraphs to ~80 words to preserve rhythm. Inline emphasis like _italics_, **bold**, and links such as [Typekit](https://typekit.com) are all fair game.

### Subheading / H3

H3 works well for subsections or callouts within the same idea.

- Bulleted list item two
- Bulleted list item three

1. Numbered item one
2. Numbered item two
3. Numbered item three

```css
:root {
  --custom-token: 1rem;
}

article code {
  font-family: var(--article-code-font-family);
}
```

End with a short closing paragraph or call to action.

<p>Examples like the ones I have discussed here--from digital image editing and iconography to hypermedia rhetoric and forms like disjunction--demonstrate that the use and reception of digital images in hypermedia environments can have powerful meaning effects.  Like more "traditional" print-based forms of signification, visual hypermedia signification is capable of participating in a broad range of semic and ideological processes, from perpetuating essentialist categories and excluding marginal elements to inscribing or gesturing toward diversity.  However, though these processes may be similar to those intersected by forms of communication that more explicitly privilege (verbal) language, digital images can do things that are impossible in those other forms.</p>

<p>Even the relatively few examples I have explored here show that interactions between the "new" visual literacy and hypermedia have enacted new processes of signification, new ways to communicate.  The form of the visual click-through metaphor, the first hypermedia-specific example I examined here, combines the rhetorical capacities of images with those of the hyperlink mechanism to provide users with distincly coded metaphors that help them navigate through vast quantities of data (at times in ways some might deem politically suspect).  Similarly, images and links colaborate in the device I labeled the synecdochic visual click-through: in this case, the rhetorical trope of synecdoche is exercised in the intersection of the representational capacity of images, the distinct associative characteristics of the hyperlink, and (in its more complex instances) the Web's dynamic content display technologies.  The increasingly meaningful uses of such hypermedia technologies, in fact, yield perhaps the best examples of emerging meaning-making conventions that are specific to hypermedia and that participate in the "new" visual literacy.  The hypermedia disjunction--my last example--exploits the distinctly hypermedia mouseover device to dynamically alter images in ways that enable the inscription of logical disjunctions.</p>

<p>That said, my coverage of the emerging meaning-making conventions specific to hypermedia is far from exhaustive.  In fact, it could never possibly <i>be</i> exhaustive: as new hypermedia technologies are put to use and enduring ones are adapted, new ways of making meaning will emerge.  Hypermedia-specific visual literacies in particular, then, help illustrate an important aspect of the qualification with which I prefaced my analysis: literacies do not have fixed, essential definitions; they are constantly in flux.  They are, in fact, always new and always emerging.</p>

<p>Given that perhaps the defining characteristic of hypermedia is the link--and, in fact, the link is the mechanism that the term "click-through" in many ways refers to--a theoretical understanding of how links work could yield useful results when applied to the question of visual click-through meaning.  The array of analytical tools possibly adaptable to this question is actually quite rich, as much has been written about the hyperlink.  The problem, of course, is that very little of this theory and criticism gives images enough attention.</p>

<p>Though some <a href="main.php?sectionID=500&citation=burnett&returnID=<%=sectionID%>&anchorID=burnett1" name="burnett1">theoretical discussions of hypertext</a> have suggested that the label "hypertext" refers not just to linked alphanumeric data but also to linked texts that include images and other media, few theoretical studies of hypertext's linking capabilities have actually addressed the specific characteristics of hyperlinks whose linked elements include <i>images</i>.  Until relatively recently, in fact, most of them have tended to focus almost exclusively on hyper<i>text</i>--in the narrow alphanumeric sense.</p>

<p>George Landow's <i><a href="main.php?sectionID=500&citation=landow&returnID=<%=sectionID%>&anchorID=landow" name="landow">Hyper/Text/Theory</a></i>, a compelling edition of essays published in 1994, is a representative example of this tendency.  To its credit, the collection contains contributions that, for the most part, do successfully underscore the notion that hypertext is a new medium with its own unique characteristics: it is not simply a neutral tool one can use to express the same meanings that the medium of printed text can produce.  Accordingly, much of the book's first section is devoted to definitions--to just what it is that we mean when we talk about hypertext.  Espen Aarseth's and Gunnar Liestøl's ontologies of hypertext and hypertextual narrative and Terence Harpold's phenomenology of the hypertext link, for example, synthesize various strands of the richly diverse field of hypertext theory, acknowledging "how preoccupied writers on the subject have been with defining hypermedia in opposition to traditional media" (Liestøl 110), while at the same time avoiding the essentialist trap of reducing the immense variety of hypertextual practices to a fixed definition of "hypertext."  In an attempt both to retain a critical vocabulary with which to describe the new phenomenon of hypertext and to do justice to its newness, then, many of this book's contributors stress that the differences between different types or modes of hypertext may be bigger than the differences between hypertextuality and print-based textuality.  As Aarseth puts it, this emphasis on the similarities between the technologies of print and hypertext enables the "new materials" (hypertext, the hyperlink, and the theories they spawn) to be used to reevaluate and modify the "old perspectives" (our assumptions about print, text, and communication) (84).</p>

<p>Yet it is precisely this emphasis--the contributors' tendency to focus on the features of hypertext for the most part only insofar as they cast a new light on print--that demonstrates one of the ways in which many studies of hypertext and the hyperlink conflate "hypertext" and "hypermedia" and thereby short-change the question of the visual.  In the end, most of the contributors to <i>Hyper/Text/Theory</i>, whether explicitly or not, bow to the primacy of print--or at least to the attempt to extend its logic to a textual context that is no longer solely alphanumeric.  The growing significance of nontextual elements (such as images) in today's hypermedia seem to be de-emphasized or even overlooked in many of their analyses.  This may be, in part, because the hypertext systems that informed these essays (published as they were in 1994) lacked the expanded image display capacities available in today's systems.  It may also be that their complicity with the ethos of print culture leads them to see the text of hypermedia as more significant than its "packaging."  As contributor Stuart Moulthrop explicitly acknowledges in his discussion of the purported political dimensions of hypertext, critical theorizing about hypertext today often leads "right back to the striated [and alphanumerically saturated] space of the library--where most humanists have always been most comfortable in the first place" (312).</p>

<p><i>Hyper/Text/Theory</i> demonstrates the way that the field of hypertext theory has been (sometimes self-critically) characterized by an attempt to approach hypermedia using an "old" visual literacy that privileges verbal meaning and marginalizes visual meaning.  This does not mean that this body of theory is entirely unusable for the question of visual click-through meaning, however.  The essential observation concerning the growing importance of images in the West's processes of signification is precisely that images are increasingly functioning in a linguistic way: as the titles they give their work indicate, "new visual literacy" thinkers like Gunther Kress and Theo van Leeuwen (<i><a href="main.php?sectionID=500&citation=kressvl3&returnID=<%=sectionID%>&anchorID=kressvl3" name="kressvl3">Reading Images</a></i>) and Robert Horn (<i><a href="main.php?sectionID=500&citation=horn2&returnID=<%=sectionID%>&anchorID=horn2" name="horn2">Visual Language</a></i>) suggest that images are more and more being viewed as meaning-productive and as functioning rhetorically.  If they are correct, then applying the insights of alphanumeric-oriented hypertext theory to hypermedia questions like visual click-through meaning may yield insights as valuable as those gained by applying verbal-oriented rhetorical theory to images in general.  If images are functioning in increasingly language-like ways, in other words, then one may be able to apply language-preoccupied notions of the hyperlink to linked images in potentially useful ways.</p>

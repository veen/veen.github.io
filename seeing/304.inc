<p>The hypermedia click-through metaphor that uses abstracted, iconic images is not the only rhetorical tool made available by the convergence of the "new" visual literacy and emerging ways of reading links rhetorically.  The trope of synecdoche--generally, substituting a part of something for its whole and vice versa--wields considerable power in hypermedia environments, where the very structure of links themselves (i.e., a small element representing and pointing to larger elements or sets of elements) suggests relations of categorical inclusion.  Again, Burbules gives a hypertextual example of this trope that demonstrates its importance:  "a list of 'Human Rights Violations' may include links to pages dealing with corporal punishment in schools, or vice versa. This relating of categorical wholes to particular instances, or of parts to wholes, is vitally important.  The power to register superordinate categories to which particulars are subsumed is a special way of influencing people's conceptual and normative thinking" (112).</p></p>

<p>The excerpt shown below from the front door of the <a href="http://www.usc.edu">University of Southern California's Website</a> demonstrates an application of this rhetorical trope using linked images.  Each of the photographic images in this excerpt link to specific sections of the site--most of which are not accessible through the front page's text links (not shown below).  The region of the image that depicts <a href="http://www.usc.edu/info/about/alumni.html" onmouseover="msoverl(3)" onmouseout="msoutl(3)">a man sitting along a winding sidewalk</a>, for example, links to a page dedicated to alumni of the university.  Given the associating characteristics of the hyperlink mechanism and the fact that this image links to what it does, the one man depicted--presumably himself a USC alumnus--stands in for the broad category of USC alumni.</p>

<p>This synecdochic association--like using the term <i>hand</i> for <i>sailor</i>, for example--is certainly an effective way to communicate concisely: in the context of their jobs, sailors essentialy are defined as sailors by the utility of their hands; the meaning produced by the depiction of the USC alumnus as he is figured here (i.e., content, satisfied!) defines the rest of the alumni body within the context of USC's Website (positioned as it is as a presentation of the university's image to the world).</p>

<p>But sailors are much more than their hands: while that part of the body may characterize a sailor functionally, it can't possibly represent those aspects of a sailor's meaning that have nothing to do with the function of hands.  Similarly, the social and cultural diversity of USC's body of alumni cannot justly be represented by a single smiling man.  The synecdochic visual click-through, then, has real potential for marginalization and exclusion.  Excercising the rhetorical power of links always entails this risk.</p>

<p>Given this risk imposed by the nature of the medium itself, USC's Website actually comes across as a rather adept use of hypermedia rhetoric--a fact that makes it a particularly appropriate part of an analysis of emerging ways of using hypermedia in meaningful ways.  To begin with, the site's visual click-throughs certainly avoid the inscription of ideologies of race and gender that they so easily could have fallen prey to: the diverse bodies of USC alumni and students are not here rhetorically homogenized by linked images of the traditionally collegiate Anglo-American male, for example.  The site also takes advantage of one of the medium's integrated technologies in an attempt to avoid the possible forms of rhetorical homogenization toward which the constraints of the medium might otherwise lead.  Every time the page is requested from USC's Web server by a Web browser application--in other words, each time a user visits the site--a section of code delivers a randomly-selected set of images (from a bank of six) to serve as the page's linked photographs.  As a result, the linked image that synecdochically stands in for USC's alumni body may depict a different member of that diverse group each time a user encounters the page (see Figure 3.7).  A user's odds of seeing a depiction repeated from one visit to the next become one in six instead of a rigid one in one.</p>

<p>Here USC takes advantage of the dynamic content-generation capacities of the medium to literally code representations of heterogeneity into the system itself.  Granted, just as the manuever cannot guarantee that a user will not encounter an image repeated in consecutive visits, it also never achieves an ultimately exhaustive representation of USC's alumni diversity: fewer than ten alumni are alternately depicted--nothing close to the immense, and annually growing, size of the alumni body.  Depicting every last member of that group would in fact be a nearly impossible task, requiring editors to pore over enormous archives of photographs--hardly worth the effort, considering the fact that such totalization may in fact be epistemically impossible: as some theorists contend, language to some extent always excludes; acts of naming arrest infintely complex flows of meaning in inevitably impoverished ways.</p>

<p>But even when seen as a <i>gesture</i> toward diversity--rather than as an ultimately exhaustive expression of it--USC's revolving image system could certainly be said to mitigate the always possible (side)effect of the synecdochic hypermedia click-through--a univocal denial of diversity, a reduction of real complexities to a simplified fragment made narrowly representative.  In exploiting the characteristics of the medium to avoid such marginalizing rhetoric, USC's site therefore demonstrates a kind of literacy that could never be achieved as effectively in the static medium of print: marks of ink on paper can't possibly change each time readers turn to a page--<a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/363/jacobson.html">not quite yet</a>, at least.  This emerging literacy combines an increasingly used and understood way of making meaning with images with a similarly increasingly used and understood way of making meaning with links and content-generation technologies in networked digital environments.</p>

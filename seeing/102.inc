<p>I must make a qualification before beginning.  I do use the term "new" when describing this particular sort of visual literacy, but doing so can be misleading.  As a number of scholars have pointed out, a way of seeing similar in some ways to this "new" way of using images has been practiced for ages in so-called "pre-literate" cultures, those in which visual representation was not or has not been subsumed by the logic of verbal language. As Kress and van Leeuwen insightfully <a href="main.php?sectionID=500&citation=kressvl2&returnID=<%=sectionID%>&anchorID=kressvl2" name="kressvl2">point out</a>, "Cultures which still retain the full use of both media of representation are, from the point of view of 'literate cultures', regarded as illiterate, impoverished, underdeveloped, when in fact they have a richer array of means of representation than that overtly and consciously available to literate cultures."  While I am not suggesting that today's emergence of new forms of visual literacy should be viewed as some sort of mythic return to pre-literate origins, I am suggesting that the meaningful ways of using images today are not entirely new, a point that Robert Horn makes so well when he compares the ancient Egyptians' use of elements like pictographs, ideographs, and determinatives to the ways contemporary Westerners are using images and text in magazines, textbooks, Websites, and so on.  The language of ancient Egypt, <a href="main.php?sectionID=500&citation=horn1&returnID=<%=sectionID%>&anchorID=horn1" name="horn1">says Horn</a>, was "the first fully developed visual language in the West."  Using the term "new" to describe the visual literacies emerging today, then, inevitably misses something.</p>

<p>An act like seeing is, moreover, <i>always</i> new and <i>always</i> different.  One of the key insights of the broadly "postmodern" critique of essentialism has been that the nature of such acts always depends upon and is specific to the contexts and social relations in which they take place.  Insofar as these contexts and relations change--which they certainly do from culture to culture and even from viewer to viewer--labeling one way of seeing "new" and another "old" makes little sense.  Even those acts of seeing that we might say rely on an "old" visual literacy are "new" each time they occur because they never occur in a contextual vacuum.  Using the categories of "old" and "new" is in this account, then, either inaccurate or simply redundant: individual instances of the old really <i>are</i> new, so refering to literacies as new does not in the end do much to distinguish them from those literacies referred to as old.</p>

<p>That qualification being made, I do however suggest that a kind of "operational" adoption of the distinction--that is, between (broadly speaking) "old" and "new" visual literacy, between a visual literacy that treats images as immediating conduits of meaning and a visual literacy that treats images as inherently mediating locations of meaning--can enable some valuable and informative types of analysis.  The distinction allows one to begin to map the different ways an approach to images as meaning-productive is increasingly characterizing acts of meaning-making that employ today's newest communications technologies.  As a result, the distinction enables the identification of processes of signification that an analysis free of the distinction would likely overlook.</p>

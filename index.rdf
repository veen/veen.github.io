<title>Black Rock City, Almost Gone</title>
<link>http://www.veen.com/greg/archives/000610.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>With endless thanks to my friend Brian (and his four-seat airplane), I had the amazing experience yesterday of seeing Nevada's Black Rock Desert from the air.  Here are some photos I took of what remains less than a week after Burning Man's Black Rock City officially ceased to exist there, having disappeared again until next year.  I was surprised to find the <em>absence</em> of the city so striking, its afterimage so intense.</p>

<title>Soaring instrumental postludes in recent indie rock</title>
<link>http://www.veen.com/greg/archives/000578.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm (possibly) just beginning to emerge from a period of deep infatuation with the music of the Killers, the Stills, Franz Ferdinand, and Interpol.  What got me hooked is that to varying degrees, these bands are expert at building instrumental texture into their songs -- a kind of sedimented layering that manages to be minimal and rich at the same time.  Cases in point: the fantastic endings (postludes, really) of songs like Interpol's "PDA" (from 3:09 to the end) and The Stills' "Ready For It" (from 3:01 to the end).  Each of these songs charges towards a deconstruction point, where its layers are suddenly stripped away.  What gets left behind is a minimal trace that is then rebuilt, layer by layer, to a grand, soaring conclusion.  Absolutely fantastic!</p>]]></description>

<title>Welcome to Portland, sponsored by...</title>
<link>http://www.veen.com/greg/archives/000582.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Shortly after boarding one of Portland, Oregon's streetcars during a visit there last weekend, I heard what seemed at first to be a run-of-the-mill automated system announcement, made by one of those computerized voices that are becoming eerily hard to distinguish from human ones: "Next stop, Taylor Street." </p>

<p>But after a short pause, the voice added: "Sponsored by Whole Foods of Portland."</p>

<p>What?  The <em>streetcar stops</em> are sponsored -- in <em>Portland</em>?</p>

<p>And it's not just the streetcar stops, I learned a minute later when the voice resumed, this time with out even a pretense of giving me important information about an upcoming stop:  "This streetcar sponsored by Hoyt Street Realty."</p>

<p>I guess it's not hugely different than the print ads on the sides of busses common in many cities, but this certainly <a href="http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/ads/ad_main.htm">turns it up a notch</a>.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>As nerdy as it is, I hereby proudly announce that I enjoyed the heck out of the Rush show I went to in Concord on Saturday night.</p>

<p>I used to be more of an actual fan than I am now.  Yet even though a lot of the evening's fun was, how do you say, <em>sociological</em> in nature (look, that middle-aged dude in the lawn seats is totally air drumming!), I have to admit that Rush <em>rocked</em>.</p>

<p>Merlin Mann seemed to <a href="http://merlinmann.buzznet.com/user/?img=2&id=365303">enjoy</a> it too.</p>]]></description>

<title>Cory Doctorow on Digital Rights Management</title>
<link>http://www.veen.com/greg/archives/000565.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>By now, the text of the <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/stuff/doctorow-drm-ms.html">speech</a> on Digital Rights Management technologies that Cory Doctorow recently gave to Microsoft's Research Group has been linked to so widely it's made its way nearly to the top of Google's search results for "DRM".  I'm mentioning it here in case you haven't heard about it somewhere else.  I highly recommend it.  The speech offers a very well-put statement on an issue that's hugely important to all of us -- the ownership and control of culture.</p>

<p>(I've linked above to Anil Dash's HTML version of the speech text instead of Doctorow's <a href="http://www.craphound.com/msftdrm.txt">original text version</a>.)</p>]]></description>

<title>Jack Valenti and me: copyfighters</title>
<link>http://www.veen.com/greg/archives/000551.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>My explorations into various understandings of intellecutal property and copyright have convinced me that our current system of copyright law is headed in a very dark direction and needs to change course soon.  According to <a href="http://culturecat.net/node/view/415">Clancy Ratliff</a> (via <a href="http://www.corante.com/copyfight/archives/004250.html">Copyfight: the politics of IP</a>) that makes me a <em>copyfighter</em>:  "a copyfighter is someone who engages in conversations on authorship and intellectual property.  [...]  Moreover, copyfighters look at our current copyright model -- automatic copyright, life + 70 years as soon as the content is put into a fixed medium -- and express some kind of qualm about it; they think it should change in some way."</p>

<p>But that definition doesn't specify <em>which</em> way the copyfighter thinks our copyright model should change.  By this standard, even the infamous Jack Valenti -- the outgoing head of the MPAA who once <a href="http://news.com.com/2008-1082-875394.html">referred to file swappers as terrorists</a> -- is a copyfighter.  Sounds like we'd need to add an adjective to make the label meaningful.  But what are the acceptible options?  <em>Left-wing</em> copyfighter?  <em>Right-wing</em> copyfighter?  <em>Progressive</em> copyfighter?  <em>Conservative</em> copyfighter?  <em>Corporate</em> copyfighter?  <em>Indie</em> copyfighter?  When <a href="http://www.lessig.org/">one of the most compelling voices</a> on what one might think should be called the <em>progressive</em> side of this fight advocates "free culture" as in "free markets", I'm not sure any of these traditional labels make much sense.</p>]]></description>

Overall, the film was excellent, though one image stands out in particular.  According to the filmmakers, the contemporary corporation -- because it has the legal rights of a person but isn't subjected to any strong accountability -- is a textbook example of a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oi=defmore&q=define:Psychopath+(or+sociopath)">psychopath</a>:  "characterized by absence of guilt and anxiety normally accompanying an antisocial act." </p>]]></description>
